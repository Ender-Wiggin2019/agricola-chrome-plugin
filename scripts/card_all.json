    "enDesc": "Mendicant I still think that the only time that the mendicant gives any sort of\nsubstantial benefit is if the action you take as an alternative allows you to\ntake an accrued resource, get family growth a turn earlier, or provides some\nbenefit not usually available. The idea behind the Mendicant, it is being proposed, is that it will\ngive not only one, but likely all of these things, simply by merit of the fact\nthat it allows one to advance play by an entire action and, thus, an entire\nround. The disconnect between this proposed concept and your interpretation\nthereof seems to be a disjoin between the abstract and the demonstrable. Usually, when speaking of choices in this game, it's practical, or at least\nfeasible, to reference what's been gained based on a choice. Building early\nstables, for example, lets you breed sheep for food. Double plow and sow before\nthe first harvest can get an early grain engine going. And so forth. In this\nsituation, however, it's counterintuitive to be specific when speaking about\nthe Mendicant and what benefit, direct or indirect, it may or may not offer if\nits 'food loan' is exercised. The Mendicant's loan does not offer sheep or\nfamily growth, per say. Instead, abstractly, it offers pace pace . Pace is the most precious resource in Agricola. It is amorphous, undefined. Yet\nit undeniably exists, and exerts its influence upon every round, upon every\naction, from start of game to end. Pace largely (though not entirely!)\ndetermines who gets their food engine going sooner, who gets their house\nenlarged sooner, who gets their family grown sooner. It determines who has time\nto spare to gather particular, specific resources and who does not. It\ndetermines who has time to fiddle with Start Player due to a surplus of pace;\nor, it determines who is compelled to fiddle with Start Player to accommodate\nfor a lack of it. In a passive-interaction, economic competition game, pace is\nking. The Mendicant is unique insofar as it offers an opportunity that no other card\ndoes. It gives the player a choice, a meta-game choice, to decide to gain gain early game pace at the expense of\n(presumably) late-game pace. It offers this power just by merit of sitting in\nthe owner's hand; the option is exercised first, the cost (i.e., putting out\nthe card) is paid later. In your observation, you critique the player for choosing not to eat his grain\nand vegetable, by merit of the supposition that he could simply replace them in\nthe next round. The counterpoint is that by exercising the Mendicant option, he\ndidn't have to take the time to replace the grain and vegetable. Instead, he\nimmediately went on to the next step in his plan, which was to use these\nresources to launch his food engine. He advanced along his intended strategic\npath, rather than repeating or, worse, regressing upon it. He gained pace.\nPerhaps in fact he merely gained a single action. But this single action can be\ncrucial, critical. Surely you have played often enough to have a fireplace\nsnatched from your fingertips, to have animals slaughtered in someone else's\nkitchen rather than your own, to be ready to enlarge your home or grow your\nfamily only to see yourself unable to do so for want of a single, extra action\nahead of an opponent's. Now instead think upon the games wherein your position\nwas well enough laid out, your pace ever so slightly ahead of the pack, that it\nwas you, and not them, who got that first family growth, forcing them to wait\nanother round to grow theirs whilst you enjoyed the fruits of your labor. The\nMendicant in your hand helps you to ensure the latter to occur more often than\nthe former. And the effective is cumulative, arguably. The Mendicant saves us an action,\ninherently -- the action of collecting two food. Instead, that action is spent\non something more beneficial to short-term strategy, such as collecting reed or\nwood for building a home extension. This in turn could lead us to growing our\nfamily one round earlier than we would have otherwise been able to. By growing\nour family one round early, we've now gained *another* action. That action,\ntoo, sets our pace forward more rapidly, eventually letting us again expand our\nhome and grow our family earlier, netting us still yet another action. Pace is\nself-perpetuating; it is exponential in its rewards. And the earlier the seed,\nthe more bountiful the harvest. And all of this pace acceleration has a strong, I would even argue devastating,\neffect on the rest of the players. The extra action(s) you gained can be used\nto gather pace-related resources. More resources for you means less for them;\neven snatching a simple stack of 3 wood is enough to ruin another player's\nplans of family growth for who knows how long. Whereas, the players who have to\nscrounge around on the Day Laborer space are simply leaving those resources\naround for others to take. That's an enormous swing in the early game. Indeed: it was just this sort of swing that spawned the discussion from which\nthis thread emerged. Someone expended their 'extra' Mendicant action to take\nthe sheep away from another player. That player's game was devastated. That\nplayer (a) had to waste his last action; (b) still took a horrid amount of\nbegging negatives; and (c) now *still* has to scrounge around for sheep to get\nhis food engine going for the next harvest. His pace was shredded. The\nMendicant holder's pace was hardly affected. That's an amazing boon. That said, the Mendicant is hardly a powerhouse. You're not going to\nwant to play this every time - just when a very juicy opportunity presents\nitself. Moreover, a smart player is going to see you take those 2 begging cards\nand immediately know that you plan on Mendicant'ing your way out. Especially if\nyou're in 2-p, she might then try to block the occupation square in the last\nround to blow you out",

Even in a\ngame where a person is able to achieve a lot of animals, pressures for food\nwill cause them to eat quite a few. As a result, you could have just used 2\nwood to split the megapasture down the middle. This should allow you to keep a\nfair amount of 2 different animals, with a single one of the third animal\ntaking up the space in your house. Sure, you might lose a few sheep by having\nto eat them early, but this will usually only cost about a point in scoring: a\npoint that is regained by the extra pasture you'll have at the end of scoring.

Given how rarely people actually\nbuild 3 rooms in the first place (usually reed is too scarce), this won't come\nup too often. If you only build two rooms, 4 wood for 1F1A is ok, I guess. However, the\n4/3/2/1 wood occupations all give 4 wood the moment you play them, not just\nwhen you build your 4th room (which, depending on how the game is going, might\ntake a while). Furthermore, the wood those occs give is no strings attached -\nyou're not required to use it to build rooms. In my experience all of the\n4/3/2/1 occs are playable, but they're by no means must-plays. Since the\nCarpenter is almost strictly worse if you're only building 2 rooms, he's\nprobably not worth it in that case. It's true that he can be used to reduce the cost of clay rooms and stone rooms\nas well as Wooden Rooms. However, I think clay and stone rooms are mostly a\ncorner case - most rooms are wood, a few are clay, and almost none are stone\n(the Well tends to be a much more efficient way to get points). Moreover, in\ncases where you actually want to build clay rooms, clay is probably common enough\nthat 2 clay and 2 wood isn't much better than 4 wood.",

Furthermore, the wood those occs give is no strings attached -\nyou're not required to use it to build rooms.

Veggies are worth 1 VP each, and\nanimals after your first one are always less than 1 VP. This means that a lot\nof the time this is just not a good deal. There's also the awkwardness involved\nwith having plentiful veggies AND fences with animals in them (but not too many\nanimals!) - an uncommon situation to find yourself in, barring unusual\ncircumstances. The best use of this improvement is when an\noccupation like the Undergardener has given you a ton of veggies. Since you're\nprobably going to easily max veggies, it can be nice to convert your excess\ncrops into some extra victory points. The card can also be a clunky way to get\na breeding pair of cattle - just take cattle at 1 and then trade in your veggie. Usually, this will have a marginal benefit, at\nbest.

Moreover, the benefit this gives you is just about as\ndubious - even if you want clay, if you spend an action to play it and an\naction to use it, you've spent 2 actions for 5 clay - that's pretty mediocre.\nThe choice to take 2 VP is fine fine , but usually you'll have a way to do that anyway, whether\nit's by plowing fields or taking singleton animals to stay in your home. Overall, the high occupation requirement, zero VPs\nand questionable benefit makes it one of the worst cards you can draw. The only\nreal use I see for it is as a desperation move in 2-p, after your opponent has\ndenied you clay.",

    "enDesc": "Lover Extra cost: 4 food Ah, the infamous lover. Certainly, in reports like this tournament thread tournament thread ,\nhe seems to be unfair. In the game, a player plays turn 2 lover and is able to\nseemingly coast to victory. Without a doubt, the Lover is one of the best\noccupations in the game. But is he broken? Playing the lover is pretty much impossible on round 1, so by 'early lover\naction,' people generally mean rounds 2, 3 or 4, with the most infamous starts\ncoming in round 2. If you play it round 2, you're going to need to take\nday-laborer once just to play it. Afterwards, you'll have either 1 or 0 food\nand will need to secure 6 food by the end of the harvest. This should take at\nleast 2 more actions. What does this mean? You've spent 4 actions to get 2\nactions before the first harvest! Another weakness with the Early Lover is that his house is still 2 rooms! A\nplayer who grows his family the old fashioned way has the option of building a\n4th room to his house and growing again. On the other hand, the Early Lover is\nstuck with his 2 room house - he's going to need 10 wood and 4 reed before he\ncan grow his family again. If he decides to eschew further 'fair' family growth\nand wait for 'Family Growth without Room,' he suffers from the fact that his 2\nroom house is pretty much unsuitable for renovation - there just won't be many\npoints in it. The final weakness is that playing the Lover early puts a giant bulls-eye on\nyour head. If your opponents are strong, they will be looking to screw you out\nof food at every possible avenue. That said, what makes the Early Lover strong is that while he is scrambling for\nfood, he is also using his extra actions to take resources off of the board.\nThe result is that while his farm might not look all that impressive, no one\nelse's will either! Pretty much everyone will be gimped by the Lover's\ninefficient scrambling, and by the end the Lover himself usually comes out\nahead. Playing the Lover on turn 2 is an all-in play - you are either going to win\nbecause of the play or lose because of it. An interesting alternative is to\nforgo playing him until around stage 3. Usually by this time, you have grown\nyour family once and have some sort of a food engine up. Hopefully, you can\nthen grab either 3 sheep or a piled fishing spot and use it to play the card.\nUsed this way, the Lover is safer and still a strong play, but doesn't have the\nswingy potential that playing him early does.",
