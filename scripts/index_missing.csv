E011,,Field,,3,,"When you play this card, immediately Plow 1 field.",,"This is such a nice deal that it's often a bad deal. If you play this card remotely early, you can pretty much count on your left hand opponent using it to take SP later. Like Corn Sheaf, you need some way to break the inherent symmetry of the card for this to be worth playing. If you plan on actually using the field to grow crops, then it's usually a good deal to play the card early. Otherwise, try to wait until the later rounds to play it, as this will hopefully minimize the number of players that will be able to use it after you.",

E013,,Axe,,4,,"Whenever you add a room to your Wooden hut, you only pay 2 Wood and 2 Reed.",,"The Axe's power varies wildly depending on the number of players. In 2-p, it can be very awkward, since usually you have to wait for the stone spot to appear in stage 2 before you can play it. In 3-p, it's somewhat easier to play (you can just rawdog the crappy wildcard resource spot), but the benefit it gives is reduced by the crushingly small amount of reed available. In 4-p the card becomes very powerful because of the RSF spot, and in 5-p it becomes an unquestionable 5 star card due to the 1S1W + R spot. In any case, the Axe is fantastic once you get it out; you will usually be able to get to 4+ rooms with it. If you build 3 wooden rooms, you are saving 8W. That's obscene.",

Clay, Stone and Wood-fired Ovens cost you 1 building resource (of your choice) less.",,"Baking Tray Baking Tray In 2-p and 3-p this card is amazing, and sometimes enough incentive for me to go baking all by itself. Saving you the early stone you need to get the Clay Oven is crucial, and being able to buy the oven with SP is fantastic as well. Since no one is likely to compete with you for the oven in 2-p and 3-p, you can plan around it. In 4-p and 5-p the value drops a bit, since getting the early stone is less crucial. Moreover, you are more likely to have competition for the clay oven, which makes the baking tray a riskier play (since it tips your hand). However, in any case it is a solid improvement that's usually worth the 1W if you plan on baking.",
E017,,Windmill,,1,,"At any time, you can convert Grain to 2 Food (without having to Bake bread.)",,"Early game, being able to convert 1G to 2F is too inefficient to be worth the substantial cost.

If you take SP with it for the final round of actions, you will be able to eat the sheep (albeit inefficiently) and hose the fireplace buyer that was letting them accumulate.

Don't be that guy. If you have to play 2 occupations you didn't really want to get out, it's probably not worth it because it neglects family growth. On the other hand, if you're lucky enough to have 3 - 4 early game occupations that you wanted to get out anyway, this play can be a backbreaker. The card gets much stronger if you are doing some sort of drafting, as it combos almost unfairly well with the Patron, Academic and Perpetual Student. With drafting you're also more likely to have four early game occupations that you actually want to play.",

the same reasons. It's not efficient enough to be a food engine on its own, and

Free 1VP occupations with inconsequential prerequisites are pretty much always worth playing, but in this case the extra ability is quite powerful. The only caveat is that you should be careful that you're not giving your opponents easy access to reed. For instance, if you're in a 3-p game and have a choice between 3C and 2R, you should consider taking the 2R to deny your opponents. As long as you're playing smartly, however, this card is borderline overpowered and a must play whenever you draw it.",

Ironically, this means that the Madonna Statue is pretty bad, despite being a card that gives VP for no cost!

Instead, you'll usually have to chuck a 1VP improvement along with a no VP improvement, and with no additional benefit this usually isn't a good deal.",

don't like paying 1W for something I could have done for free, and the fact
that you can't play a major improvement along the way further reduces the
card's efficiency. Sometimes you'll look at your hand after you FG and have
nothing better to play, but you're not losing much value by just keeping it in
your hand. The value of the card goes up, however, if you
plan on playing an occupation that requires you to renovate to clay quickly.

existence of the Family Growth without Room spot. The more likely you are to
get the spot, the less likely it is that this late-game card is going to help
you grow your family. Viewed strictly as a 3 point play, the card is fairly
underwhelming; both the Well and the Stone Oven are better with comparable
cost. The fact that this is a minor isn't too relevant, since renovating to
stone implies at least one chance to get a major.",

sheep to give to this, it's probably more efficient to just breed the sheep you
spent an action taking (you didn't just take ONE sheep, did you?). Yes, I'm
aware of the animal spot in 5-p. Even then, taking 1 sheep, then trading it for
a cow, and then taking a cow just seems like a waste of time. Why don't you
just take 1 cow twice? The only use this card tends to have is as a bad,
highly conditional horse. If you have some awkward number of sheep near the end

favorite plow. For one, the 4W, 3 Occ price tag is extremely steep. Second,
since every field after the 5th is generally unnecessary, maximizing the plow's
value requires that you don't plow a single field before you play the card out.
Even then, you still get an almost useless 6th field. Many times I've seen players excitedly play this
card out, only to be disappointed in their final score. A lot of the time, the
exorbitant cost on the card (coupled with the hidden cost of not being able to
plow for almost the entire game) make it more trouble than it's worth.",

you're going to want to sow it. However, sowing just 1 vegetable is usually a
bad deal, so you'll probably take a grain and plow 2 fields before you sow.
Then, when the 'Take one Vegetable' space appears, you'll look at your 4
vegetables and your sown grain and wonder why you would ever want 1 more of
either. Has some use in that sometimes you just need to get your 4th occ, and paying

require 3 or 4 occupations, and is fine (but not spectacular) in that narrow
role. At best he is saving you 1F1A to just play another Occ. Usually, the
benefit will be less than that due to the fact that playing 2 different occs
would give you at least some sort of beneficial effect.",

is only one clay oven. Moreover, the extra bakes are usually going to be too
random to be very useful. The extra 4 or so food he gives over time isn't
particularly impressive, either.",

Assuming you play him with an oven and two grain fields, you should never go
hungry. The strength of this Occ varies depending on the number of players in the game.
In a 2-p game, baking strategies are horrible. For one thing, there is no early
way to get stone. For another, there are so many animals in a 2er that you not
only want them for yourself, but want to prevent your opponent from having all
of them! In a 3-p, baking is still pretty bad due to the lack of early stone,
but often the Baker is powerful enough to merit playing him anyway. In 4-p and 5-p, baking is viable enough to make the Baker a strong incentive to
bake.",
E152,,Berry Picker,,3,,"Whenever you use a Family member's action to take Wood, you receive an additional 1 Food.",,"Berry Picker An extremely annoying card - I've taken to calling myself 'berry-picked' in
games where someone plays this or the Mushroom Collector and spends every round
taking wood. However, this card is not quite as strong as it seems. Ultimately, it's worth
about 5 or 6 food by the end (assuming they take wood 6 or 7 times), which is
only passable given that the food is delivered over time. What makes the card
seem stronger than it actually is is that it causes newer players to value the
wood spots correctly. In 5-p, the Berry Picker can be used to spam the WSR spot, giving it added
utility.",
E153,,Mendicant,,1,,"At the end of the game, you can discard up to 2 Begging card without losing points for them.",,"Mendicant I still think that the only time that the mendicant gives any sort of
substantial benefit is if the action you take as an alternative allows you to
take an accrued resource, get family growth a turn earlier, or provides some
benefit not usually available. The idea behind the Mendicant, it is being proposed, is that it will
give not only one, but likely all of these things, simply by merit of the fact
that it allows one to advance play by an entire action and, thus, an entire
round. The disconnect between this proposed concept and your interpretation
thereof seems to be a disjoin between the abstract and the demonstrable. Usually, when speaking of choices in this game, it's practical, or at least
feasible, to reference what's been gained based on a choice. Building early
stables, for example, lets you breed sheep for food. Double plow and sow before
the first harvest can get an early grain engine going. And so forth. In this
situation, however, it's counterintuitive to be specific when speaking about
the Mendicant and what benefit, direct or indirect, it may or may not offer if
its 'food loan' is exercised. The Mendicant's loan does not offer sheep or
family growth, per say. Instead, abstractly, it offers pace pace . Pace is the most precious resource in Agricola. It is amorphous, undefined. Yet
it undeniably exists, and exerts its influence upon every round, upon every
action, from start of game to end. Pace largely (though not entirely!)
determines who gets their food engine going sooner, who gets their house
enlarged sooner, who gets their family grown sooner. It determines who has time
to spare to gather particular, specific resources and who does not. It
determines who has time to fiddle with Start Player due to a surplus of pace;
or, it determines who is compelled to fiddle with Start Player to accommodate
for a lack of it. In a passive-interaction, economic competition game, pace is
king. The Mendicant is unique insofar as it offers an opportunity that no other card
does. It gives the player a choice, a meta-game choice, to decide to gain gain early game pace at the expense of
(presumably) late-game pace. It offers this power just by merit of sitting in
the owner's hand; the option is exercised first, the cost (i.e., putting out
the card) is paid later. In your observation, you critique the player for choosing not to eat his grain
and vegetable, by merit of the supposition that he could simply replace them in
the next round. The counterpoint is that by exercising the Mendicant option, he
didn't have to take the time to replace the grain and vegetable. Instead, he
immediately went on to the next step in his plan, which was to use these
resources to launch his food engine. He advanced along his intended strategic
path, rather than repeating or, worse, regressing upon it. He gained pace.
Perhaps in fact he merely gained a single action. But this single action can be
crucial, critical. Surely you have played often enough to have a fireplace
snatched from your fingertips, to have animals slaughtered in someone else's
kitchen rather than your own, to be ready to enlarge your home or grow your
family only to see yourself unable to do so for want of a single, extra action
ahead of an opponent's. Now instead think upon the games wherein your position
was well enough laid out, your pace ever so slightly ahead of the pack, that it
was you, and not them, who got that first family growth, forcing them to wait
another round to grow theirs whilst you enjoyed the fruits of your labor. The
Mendicant in your hand helps you to ensure the latter to occur more often than
the former. And the effective is cumulative, arguably. The Mendicant saves us an action,
inherently -- the action of collecting two food. Instead, that action is spent
on something more beneficial to short-term strategy, such as collecting reed or
wood for building a home extension. This in turn could lead us to growing our
family one round earlier than we would have otherwise been able to. By growing
our family one round early, we've now gained *another* action. That action,
too, sets our pace forward more rapidly, eventually letting us again expand our
home and grow our family earlier, netting us still yet another action. Pace is
self-perpetuating; it is exponential in its rewards. And the earlier the seed,
the more bountiful the harvest. And all of this pace acceleration has a strong, I would even argue devastating,
effect on the rest of the players. The extra action(s) you gained can be used
to gather pace-related resources. More resources for you means less for them;
even snatching a simple stack of 3 wood is enough to ruin another player's
plans of family growth for who knows how long. Whereas, the players who have to
scrounge around on the Day Laborer space are simply leaving those resources
around for others to take. That's an enormous swing in the early game. Indeed: it was just this sort of swing that spawned the discussion from which
this thread emerged. Someone expended their 'extra' Mendicant action to take
the sheep away from another player. That player's game was devastated. That
player (a) had to waste his last action; (b) still took a horrid amount of
begging negatives; and (c) now *still* has to scrounge around for sheep to get
his food engine going for the next harvest. His pace was shredded. The
Mendicant holder's pace was hardly affected. That's an amazing boon. That said, the Mendicant is hardly a powerhouse. You're not going to
want to play this every time - just when a very juicy opportunity presents
itself. Moreover, a smart player is going to see you take those 2 begging cards
and immediately know that you plan on Mendicant'ing your way out. Especially if
you're in 2-p, she might then try to block the occupation square in the last
round to blow you out",
E154,,Master Brewer,,3,,"In the Feeding phase of each Harvest, the Master Brewer can convert up to 1 Grain to 3 Food.",,"Master Brewer Being able to convert 1 grain to 3 food every harvest without taking a bake
action is a very good deal. While this can't be your main source of food, a
single sowed grain field can be a nice secondary food source to tide you over
while you set yourself up for family growth and a more robust food engine. His usefulness is limited, however, by the fact that you need to be sowing
grain in the early game to use him. This isn't always the best path to go, as
the Master Brewer on his own isn't quite a good enough reason to prioritize
grain sowing over FG and early fireplace (which, barring cards, are the
superior lines of play).",

difficulty in acquiring the stone oven, this is almost always the case. One argument I've heard for him is that it turns your Cooking Hearth into an
unlimited Stone Oven. The main problem with this line of thought is that you
are going to need to be baking a LOT before the food bonus this guy gives
becomes worth the 1F1A. How often do you actually find yourself baking 6+
grain?",

spend another action collecting reed to build your first room. Note that the
minor improvements he reduces doesn't include the Landing Net or Reed Hut

Storehouse and Water Mill (which are close to unplayable). Still, in games
where reed is tight, he can be a nice boost.",

Build Room(s) and FG spots, people get edged out a good deal. Oftentimes
someone will take SP just to ensure an early FG in the next round. Combined
with the ability to take FG w/o room as your last action one or two times in
the end game, he is almost a must play regardless of the rest of your hand. In 5-p games, his utility decreases - with 2 FG spots and 2 build room spots,
you are once again unlikely to get blocked. While he does help you get the
'good' Build Room and FG spots, the chance to buy a stable or some
random minor improvement isn't usually that essential. A key weakness of this occ is that while you won't ever get blocked from the
relevant spots, you also will tend to refrain from blocking anyone else. The
result is often higher scores for everyone, not just yourself.",

ever be worth it.",
E161,,Fisherman,,3,,"Whenever you use the ""Fishing"" Action space, you can choose to take twice as much Food as is on the space. If you do this, you must give 1 Food each to the Fishing Rod, Raft, Canoe, Fish Trap and Landing Net.",,"Fisherman Assuming you're playing with all of the decks, the various fisherman
improvements should be fairly rare. Even if one gets played, it's not too bad
because that player is less likely to take the Fishing spot from you to deny
you food. As a whole, this card works best when played with semi-experienced players.
Good players tend to avoid the fishing spot unless it gets to 4 or even more,
but will adjust to deny you the food if you let the spot get too high. Newer
players that struggle with feeding their family will take it when it's at 3 or
even 2. As a result, the presence of even one newbie can hurt this occ a lot.
The sweet spot is a group of players who are right in between: they can feed
their family reasonably well without resorting to fishing, but aren't too
concerned with what you're doing. That said, the ability to get 6 or even 8 food with a single action is amazing,
especially if this happens early. Just make sure you don't get too greedy;
players will eventually deny you the food if you let the spot pile too high.",

usually unpopular enough that you can take it if you really want to. The real
draw of this card is the 'Plow and Sow' part. You can get 2 or 3 guaranteed
'Plow and Sow' actions, which is an undeniably strong spot. However, he's even
stronger than that. In the final round of the game, he ensures that you can
plow before before you plow and sow. This is always the
optimal order to do the two actions, and the Field Warden is one of the only
ways to enable this play.",

comes with each of them gives you enough time to get them into the ground.

veggies for food with a cooking hearth, while the grain he forces you to take

still great.",

irrelevant ability playing two minor improvements, which effectively reduces
the number of times you can take SP. This time, however, you have to pay food
just to do it! The only added utility that the Merchant has is being able to buy two Major
improvements at once. This is also an almost useless ability. If you have that

vegetable feeding engine. You'll have to combine him with something else like
the Potato Dibber before you can start eating vegetables reliably. In that

as your main source of food. Nonetheless, this guy is usually worth playing simply because the free sow is

another action collecting the clay when you could have just taken 2 or 3 stone
directly still makes this a fringe play.",

players the card becomes more of a conditional play, since clay should already
be plentiful after round 6. If you play him, it should be with the intention of

hopefully prevent clay from being too easy to get for your opponents.",
E188,,Clay Mixer,,4,,"Whenever one of your people's actions gives you only Clay, you receive 2 additional Clay.",,"Clay Mixer A strong card - usually worth about 6 clay, and you'll get most of that clay

specific areas, and instead rewards last-minute diversification. As a result
you generally won't have much incentive for maxing areas with the intention of
getting points on this guy, because you could probably be getting just as many
points by filling in negatives. That said, you only really need 3 areas maxed for him to be worth the action.

particularly in games where clay is tight enough to make clay rooms unfeasible.
1 food a round is nice, but you're never going to be able to abuse this card
too much. Once you get to 3 rooms, you might want to go for a renovation in
stage 3. If you play her by the end of round 9, she'll be worth 4 food (5 food
minus the one you took to play him). That's ok, but not worth the effort of
jumping through the necessary hoops.",

early rounds and then using this guy to catch up. Random note: this is a
hilarious combo with the Lover.",
E194,,Plow Driver,,1,,"Once you have a Stone house, you can pay 1 Food at the start of each round to Plow (at most) 1 field.",,"Plow Driver This is another card that asks you to get a stone renovation unreasonably

E195,,Plow Maker,,2,,"Whenever you use either the ""Plow 1 field"" or ""Plow 1 field and/or Sow"" Action spaces, you can pay 1 Food to Plow 1 additional field.",,"Plow Maker This is another trap card - he looks much stronger than he actually is. Let's assume that you play this guy with the intention of maxing fields. To get
5 fields, you're going to need 4 actions (1 to play the Occ, 3 to plow) and 3
food (1 to play the Occ, 2 to plow). This is not appreciably better than just
plowing a field 5 times, since the 3 food he costs will probably take another
action anyway.",
E196,,Mushroom Collector,,4,,"Whenever you use a Family member's action to take Wood from an Action space, you can leave 1 of the Wood on the space and take 2 Food in exchange.",,"Mushroom Collector Amazingly strong. He's basically a Cabinetmaker that gets to use his ability
every time you take wood. If you play him, you're pretty much taking wood every
time you can. In that time, he generates an absurd amount of food - usually
enough for the first two harvests. He also gives you plenty of wood, of course.
Since you have such a large incentive to take wood, you're taking it much more
often than usual, which balances out the wood you have to leave behind. Mushroom Collector can be risky in 2-p. Because he leaves behind a wood, your
opponent will usually want to take the 4W (a very strong spot for 2-p) and deny
you the food.",

I've seen players score higher than 60 points. Harnessing the Occ's power is no
cakewalk, but when correctly played with the right combination of cards, this
is pretty much unstoppable. I admit my rating scale breaks down a bit here - if you only look at the
percentage of time he is playable, he is probably a three star card. However, I
give the extra star simply because of his raw power - he's engineered more flat
out blowouts and unreal comebacks than any other card I can think of. The card is also easily a 5 star card in draft, where you can tailor your hand
to include many cheap improvements.",

(*) Offspring are a player's 3rd, 4th, and 5th Family members.",,"Ratcatcher On the surface, you're trading 1 food and 1 action for 2 actions from your
opponents. That's ok. However, the card is actually much subtler than that. For
one, the action you spend to play him comes before the actions that your
opponents lose. Since actions are more valuable in the early rounds than the
later ones, this makes him a worse deal than he seems. But it's actually even more complex than that. Because the game is designed to
have more appealing spots as the game progresses, removing 3 or 4 actions from
a given round will mean that the quality of your final actions in that round
will be much higher than usual. As a whole, this is a card that I get out if I have the time, but don't sweat
too much if I need to use my actions in round 9 to develop my own board.",
E199,,Renovator,,2,,"Pay 2 less Clay to renovate to a Clay hut, and pay 2 less Stone to renovate to a Stone house.",,"Renovator Obviously you can't play this unless you're sure you'll be able to renovate
twice by the time the game is over. In that case, paying 1F1A for two stone and
two clay is an OK deal, but often you're better off just taking those resources
directly to deny your opponents.",
E200,,Conservator,,5,,You can renovate your Wooden hut to a Stone house without first needing to renovate it to a Clay hut.,,"Conservator Obviously redonkulous. This saves youâ€š what? 1 reed, 3-5 clay, and 1 renovation
action? Absurd. One supposed weakness to the occ is that you don't get to play a free
Major/Minor Improvement. However, this isn't a valid concern. Let's compare
someone who renovates fairly and someone who uses the Conservator and then
spends an action on the Major/Minor Improvement space. The 'fair' player: Spends 2 actions renovating Spends about 1 action collecting 3-5 clay Spends about 1/2 of an action collecting 1 reed The Conservator: Spends 1 action playing the Conservator Spends 1 action renovating Spends 1 action playing major/minor improvement Even in this case the Conservator is better (he saves about half an action).
However, the Conservator has 2 additional benefits on top of that: 1) You don't have to buy the Major improvement if there is a more efficient way
of gaining points. For instance, rather than spending 1A on 3 stone and 1A on
Major/Minor to get a well, you can just plow 2 fields. 2) You can wait until much later to renovate. Because of the limited number of
renovation spots, the 'fair' player needs to renovate to clay fairly
early if he wants to get to stone. That means he also has to collect clay and
reed fairly early. The Conservator can just wait until the last possible
moment. I have played this card literally every time I've gotten him, and I'm pretty
sure I've never made a mistake in doing so. In competitive games where
resources are tight, he has singlehandedly won me the game by ensuring me a
stone renovation that otherwise would have been impossible. That's a good sign
of a five star card.",

their finger on their mouth and say, 'Shhhhhhh!' His value is slightly worse than the Cattle Breeder, since you have to play him
earlier.",

simply amazing. He generates a ton of food early as you get your grain engine
set up, and then gives you early veggies (plus more food!) in stage 2. This is
a pet favorite of many people at BGG, and with good reason.",
E203,,Shepherd,,1,,"During each Harvest, if you have at least 4 Sheep during the Breeding phase, you receive 2 lambs instead of 1 as long as you have room for them.",,"Shepherd I gave the Sheep Whisperer one star, and this is even worse than that. There's
simply no way you're going to be able to get 4 sheep and room for two more
before the second harvest, so you're only going to get a maximum of 4 extra
sheep from him. The Sheep Whisperer gives the same amount of food, and doesn't
force you to already have sheep just to get more sheep. Like all things in
Agricola, sheep have diminishing returns - if you already have 4 sheep, there
isn't much value in getting 4 more.",
E204,,Master Shepherd,,2,,"Place 1 Sheep on each of the next 3 Round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you receive the Sheep.",,"Master Shepherd Deceptively weak. The problem is that he tempts you into building early fences,

growth. If you wait until after FG to use him, then the 3 sheep over time is
not even that appealing, since the sheep square will have been piling up for
some time.",
E205,,Reed Collector,,3,,"Place 1 Reed on each of the next 4 Round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you receive the Reed.",,"Reed Collector This is amazingly strong in 3-p, where reed is extremely tight. However, in 4-p
and 5-p reed becomes more plentiful, making him substantially worse. Still, in
any case he will tend to save you a full action, since 4 reed usually takes 2
actions to get. I don't buy the 'this gives your opponents more reed' argument that
WhiteKong uses in his 'Complex Strategies for Agricola' article. In
order to build rooms, people need both reed AND wood. The action that the Reed
Collector saves you lets you take wood instead, setting you up for a potential
2 room play and denying your opponents from rooms just as surely as if you had
taken the reed.",
E206,,Swineherd,,2,,"Whenever you use the ""Take 1 Wild boar"" Action space, you receive 1 additional Wild Boar from the supply. (The ""Take 1 Wild Boar"" Action is added in Stage 3.)",,"Swineherd This is much, much worse than either the cowherd or the sheep farmer. The
cowherd has a more powerful effect and lets you spam the cow spot at 1 until
the end of the game - no one cares enough about boar for that to really be
worth doing on the boar spot. Moreover, the sheep spot comes out much earlier
(allowing you to take it more often), and the sheep farmer has a nice clause
that lets you convert your excess sheep into cattle and boar in the mid to late
game.",

unless you have minor improvements that require stone.",
E211,,Stonecutter,,3,,"All Improvements, Rooms and Renovations cost 1 Stone less.",,"Stone Cutter Worth it if you plan on buying a clay oven, since this guy can save you a full

less useful as food becomes more plentiful. Generally, this needs to be played
early to be worth it. The card is helped by more TP cards - either for you or
your opponent. If you have them then you can sometimes set up a nice combo
where you are using TP every turn with some sort of bonus. If your opponent has
them you can use the Dancer to block the TP square in the early game, stunting
their development.",

progresses the benefit he gives becomes minimal.",

in it. Then you'll be able to house all the animals you could ever want. In
this outstanding case, what has he saved you? About 2 wood! Let me explain. It is very rare to have more than 4 of each animal. Even in a
game where a person is able to achieve a lot of animals, pressures for food
will cause them to eat quite a few. As a result, you could have just used 2
wood to split the megapasture down the middle. This should allow you to keep a
fair amount of 2 different animals, with a single one of the third animal
taking up the space in your house. Sure, you might lose a few sheep by having
to eat them early, but this will usually only cost about a point in scoring: a
point that is regained by the extra pasture you'll have at the end of scoring. Obviously 1F1A in exchange for 2 wood is a terrible deal. This occupation is
never playable - you're better off just taking 3 more wood.",

gives you a boost towards eventually getting the bonus. However, a key problem
with the Reeve is that he's an early game occ. Usually in games where I want to
play a lot of Occs, it's because I have a lot of good early game Occs. When I
have a lot of early game Occs, I tend to prioritize getting them out before the
Reeve, and often the opportunity to get 4 wood has passed by at that point. Nonetheless, he is definitely one of the stronger 4/3/2/1 occs.",

but not fantastic deal given that the wood is delivered over time and that
you're forced to use it on a specific thing. Given how rarely people actually
build 3 rooms in the first place (usually reed is too scarce), this won't come
up too often. If you only build two rooms, 4 wood for 1F1A is ok, I guess. However, the
4/3/2/1 wood occupations all give 4 wood the moment you play them, not just
when you build your 4th room (which, depending on how the game is going, might
take a while). Furthermore, the wood those occs give is no strings attached -
you're not required to use it to build rooms. In my experience all of the
4/3/2/1 occs are playable, but they're by no means must-plays. Since the
Carpenter is almost strictly worse if you're only building 2 rooms, he's
probably not worth it in that case. It's true that he can be used to reduce the cost of clay rooms and stone rooms
as well as Wooden Rooms. However, I think clay and stone rooms are mostly a
corner case - most rooms are wood, a few are clay, and almost none are stone
(the Well tends to be a much more efficient way to get points). Moreover, in
cases where you actually want to build clay rooms, clay is probably common enough
that 2 clay and 2 wood isn't much better than 4 wood.",
E338,,Feed Pellets,,2,,"During the Feeding Phase of each Harvest, you may trade 1 Vegetable for 1 of any type of Animal that you already have in your farmyard.",,"Feed Pellets Feed Pellets I hate ragging on completely free improvements,
but this is definitely a niche ability. Veggies are worth 1 VP each, and
animals after your first one are always less than 1 VP. This means that a lot
of the time this is just not a good deal. There's also the awkwardness involved
with having plentiful veggies AND fences with animals in them (but not too many
animals!) - an uncommon situation to find yourself in, barring unusual
circumstances. The best use of this improvement is when an
occupation like the Undergardener has given you a ton of veggies. Since you're
probably going to easily max veggies, it can be nice to convert your excess
crops into some extra victory points. The card can also be a clunky way to get
a breeding pair of cattle - just take cattle at 1 and then trade in your veggie. Usually, this will have a marginal benefit, at
best. Still, it's hard to argue with the price-tag.",
E341,,Guildmaster,,2,,"You receive 4 Wood when you acquire the Joinery or play the Cabinetmaker. When you acquire the Pottery or play the Potter, you receive 4 Clay. When you acquire the Basketmaker's Workshop or play the Basketmaker, you receive 3 Reed. If you have already played any of these cards when you play the Guildmaster, you receive 2 building resources of the appropriate type for each existing card.",,"Guildmaster Ridiculous when combined with the right cards (manufacturer), but otherwise
awkward. Without something to help him, you're going to need 4 stone to get two
of the three things on his list - stone that probably would have been better
used on either a renovation or a well.",
D175,,Countryman,,2,,"Each time any player (including you) takes a ""Renovation"" action on an action space, you can sow crops in exactly 1 field.",,"Countryman In bigger games the sow and bake bread space tends to be overcrowded, making
this guy's utility extremely unreliable. It's not like you should really be
giving your opponents an excuse to deny you a sow action. If for some reason
your opponents all inexplicably avoid growing crops, he can help save you an
action or two.",
C044,,Chicken Coop,,5,,"Place 1 food on each of the next 8 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,"Chicken Coop Chicken Coop With no prerequisite and a flexible cost, it's
usually pretty easy to get this out for the full 8 food. That's an amazing deal
when you factor in the 1 VP. The only time this isn't an absolute must-play is
in 3-p, where sometimes you won't be able to spare the reed. For every other
mode, this is one of the best improvements in the game.",
E126,,Tax Collector,,4,,"Once you live in a stone house, at the start of each round, you get your choice of 2 wood, 2 clay, 1 reed, or 1 stone.",," In a big game, Tax collector might bring in 5 or 6 free resources, plus whatever you buy. Slightly awkward in that it gives you resources when others build improvements, but those resources are often most useful for buying the Majors yourself. Still, very high upside. Should be banned in FotM. ",
