C174,,Stone Custodian,,,,石材保管人,编辑中,"At the end of each work phase, if 1 stone accumulation space has stone left, you get 1 grain If 2 stone accumulation spaces have stone left, you get 1 vegetable instead.",,,
D175,,Countryman,,D,,田舎農夫,,"Each time any player (including you) takes a ""Renovation"" action on an action space, you can sow crops in exactly 1 field.",,"Countryman In bigger games the sow and bake bread space tends to be overcrowded, making
this guy's utility extremely unreliable. It's not like you should really be
giving your opponents an excuse to deny you a sow action. If for some reason
your opponents all inexplicably avoid growing crops, he can help save you an
action or two.",
A111,,Wall Builder,,,,壁装飾人,即使一次增筑2栋，也只会发动1次。在忙着增筑增员的场面里，打出后再下4吃饭有点太悠长。如果有日曜大工或建筑的狮子之类的增筑手压缩，表现还算不错。,"Each time you build at least 1 room, you can place 1 food on each of the next 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
D114,,Seed Trader,,,,種商人,只要有饭就能大量买种子，不过还是很贵。如果有强力的饭基盘，那就是一个选项。,Place 2 grain and 2 vegetables on this card. You can buy them at any time. Each grain costs 2 food; each vegetable costs 3 food.,,,
D128,,Building Tycoon,,,,建設の獅子,虽然很吃饭，但能把容易拥挤的增筑格子进行手牌压缩很优秀。不过也有依赖他人的一面，切勿过信。若其他玩家打出了这张卡，行动时要注意别让人插进增员格子。也可通过日雇农夫或左官进行的增筑来启动。,"Each time after another player builds 1 or more rooms, you can give them 1 food to build exactly 1 room yourself. (You must pay the building cost of the room.)",,,
D107,,Bellfounder,,,,釣鐘鋳造師,单独使用时不太好运营，但有很多可以联动的卡牌，比如地质学家、黏土送货人、矿工等。,"In the returning home phase of each round, if you have at least 1 clay, you can use this card to discard all of your clay and get your choice of 3 food or 1 bonus point.",,,
D146,,Porter,,,,荷物運搬人,如果能去4次就能回本，但有点不稳定。,"Each time you take at least 4 of the same building resource from an accumulation space, you get 1additional building resource of the accumulating type and 1 food.",,,
D155,,Ebonist,,,,黒檀細工職人,稳定的小麦补助。收获时要特别注意不要忘记操作。,"Each harvest, you can use this card to turn exactly 1 wood into 1 food and 1 grain.",,,
E127,,Diligent Farmer,,,,勤勉な農夫,要在中盘发动的话有点难的效果。可以在14R打出并进行石家增筑，最多也能做到3分，但由于效果的关系，田地和栅栏很容易把版面占满，不提前准备好增筑空间也是不容易运用的点之一。,"When you play this card, if you would score the maximum 4 points in 3 scoring categories (including fenced stables), you can extend your house by 1 room at no cost.",,,
E130,,Overachiever,,,,やり手,家具筹措人的亲戚。虽然没有爆发力，但能稳定地瞄准3次起动。还能减轻かま調和窯的成本，这点很让人高兴。,"Each time you use a ""Wish for Children"" action space, you can play 1 additional improvement by paying its cost less 1 resource of your choice.",,,
E131,,Market Master,,,,市場長,从开局起就能在不消耗饭的情况下把职业摆出来很强力。有小剧场combo的话更不用说。因为是先获得食料再出职业，所以即使出了涂装艺术家或魔术师，出的那回合效果也不会启动。,"Immediately after each time you place your last person in a round on the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you can play 1 occupation for an occupation cost of 1 food.",,,
E132,,Veggie Lover,,,,野菜愛好家,粮食和分数的转换效率都还不错。和优秀的田地辅助或播种辅助搭配使用吧。,Harvest: At most 1 time 1 Grain+1 Vegetable → 6 Food Scoring: 1 Grain+1 Vegetable/2 Grain+2 Vegetable/3 Grain+3 Vegetable → 2/4/6 bonus points,,,
E135,,Pickler,,,,ピクルス作り,如果要活用田地和蔬菜的话，是很优秀的4木职业。,"If there are still 1/3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 1/2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with the most total vegetables gets 3 bonus points.",,,
E137,,Flax Farmer,,,,亜麻農家,如果能稳定进2芦苇的话，就是还不错的小麦辅助。用小麦格连招打出来的话，想确保芦苇的用法。,"Each time you use the ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you also get 1 grain. Each time you use the ""Grain Seeds"" action space, you also get 1 reed.",,,
E138,,Livestock Expert,,,,家畜の専門家,由于要在11R以前出，所以如果大量增加的话，确保存放饲养空间似乎会很困难。把家畜翻倍后立刻烤掉的场景看起来会很多。,"If you play this card in round 11 or before, choose an animal type: you immediately get a number of animals of that type equal to the number you already have on your farm.",,,
E140,,Carter,,,,荷馬車の運転手,在下回合有机会拿到6木或6砖的时机打出吧。因为不是累积格就无法发挥效果，所以要注意。由于强化小行动的效果很多，场上的资源越是饱和就越强力。有森林保护者在场时也更容易发挥作用。,"Next round, each time you use a building resource accumulation space, you also get 1 food for each building resource that you take from the space.",,,
E142,,Smuggler,,,,密輸業者,由于也会出现小麦和石头都稍微不够的情况，所以用这种灵活好用的效果算是还不错。在木头占比重的局面下，果然就很难发挥其效果。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, you can exchange up to 2 goods as follows: 1 Wood → 1 Grain or 1 Grain → 1 Stone",,,
E146,,Reseller,,,,転売人,在拿取水井、石窑等时先放出来比较稳妥。拿取篮子制品等时也一样，因为可以有效利用回收回来的芦苇，所以更容易运用。,"Once this game, immediately after playing or building an improvement, you can choose to get its printed cost from the general supply.",,,
E147,,Animal Driver,,,,家畜乗り,效果不坏，但条件有点偏苛刻。,"At the start of each harvest, if you have 1/2/3+ fenced stables, you get 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle.",,,
E148,,Lazybones,,,,怠け者,如果有日雇组合的话就是4厩。光是3厩也已经是相当不错的效果。,"Place (up to) 1 stable each on ""Grain Seeds"", ""Farmland"", ""Day Laborer"", and ""Farm Expansion"". Build the stable at no cost when another player uses that action space.",,,
E150,,Rock Beater,,,,石打ち,和“资材市场系”的连锁卡组合一起出会比较稳妥。如果有木匠或木匠的铁锤，也可以瞄准石制多户增筑。再加上捆柴或采石的话，就是次世代型公寓。,You can use an action space providing both stone and a different building resource even if it is occupied by another player. Stone rooms cost you 2 stone less each.,,,
E152,,Bargain Hunter,,,,バーゲンハンター,如果可以的话，想和小剧场相关的Combo和套装一起运用。,"At the start of each round, you can place 1 food from your supply on the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space to play a minor improvement by paying its cost.",,,
E153,,Stone Sculptor,,,,石の彫刻家,森林保护者、发掘者、万事屋等，只要能大量出石，就能不费力地拿到6分6饭。如果没法轻松供应石头，那就别出这个，去瞄准井户似乎更强。,"Each harvest, you can use this card to exchange exactly 1 stone for 1 bonus point and 1 food.",,,
E154,,Margrave,,,,辺境伯,自身改建成石屋时也能拿到2饭。若以饭为目的，大多数情况下用仆人会更好操作吧。终盘多半会为了得分目的而打出。,"Once you live in a stone house, you get 2 food each time any player renovates and, during scoring, 1 bonus point for each wood house and clay house.",,,
E155,,Visionary,,,,空想家,只要先拉出4根栅栏，就能从第1ステ开始进行野猪繁殖，连蔬菜和石头也能拿到。只要除自己以外的3个人都按部就班地扩建增员，这效果就相当优秀。自己走2軒进行的情况下当然也很强。在竞技场规则里感觉会被禁用。,"If you play this card in round 4 or before, you get 1 stone, 1 vegetable, and 2 wild boar. You cannot grow your family until round 11, unless all other players already have.",,,
E157,,Usufructuary,,,,使用権利人,在1ステ结束时打出来的话，感觉能到5饭左右。,"When you play this card as your first occupation, you immediately get 1 food for every other occupation in play (by any player), up to a maximum of 7 food.",,,
E158,,Stone Custodian,,,,,,"At the end of each work phase, you get 1 food for each stone accumulation space with stone on it.",,,
E159,,Old Miser,,,,老いた守銭奴,人类大猩猩化计划。如果在第1ステ放出，若是以最快冲到5人为目标的玩法风格，就会以失去5分为代价，换来大约20〜25饭左右的产出。没有井户或比较强的盘外点卡的话，果然还是赢不到最后。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, each of your people requires 1 less food. During scoring, your people are worth 2 points each instead of 3.",,,
E160,,Kelp Gatherer,,,,海藻集め,虽然依赖他人，但似乎能产出约3个蔬菜左右。种植蔬菜并在厨房烤制等加以利用吧。如果有渔业Combo就能大量入手，但相应地渔业Combo的玩家也会受益，因此需要格外警惕。,"Each time another player uses the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, they get 1 additional food and you get 1 vegetable.",,,
E161,,Elder Baker,,,,パン職人の長老,第1次踩3小麦做石窑，再踩一次3小麦后用“谷物活用”进行2播2烤，应该会成为基本打法。死守石窑，只要“谷物活用”不出事故，光靠这一张就足够成为稳定的吃饭基盘。,"This card is an action space for you only. When you use it, you get 3 grain. You can build the ""Stone Oven"" major improvement even when taking a ""Minor Improvement"" action.",,,
E162,,Entrepreneur,,,,起業家,1饭换2资材，换算效率相当优秀，但限定为自己没有的资材，稍微有点不好用。像雕刻学科或钟铸造师那样，如果能频繁把资材用完，就更容易发挥作用。,"At the start of each round, you can move 1 food to this card or discard 1 food from it. If you do either, you get 1 building resource of a type you currently do not have.",,,
E163,,Patroness,,,,女パトロン,虽然是用于职业套牌，但和赞助人相比，缺点是它本身并不能对排列职业作出贡献。准备另外的食物基础吧。,"Each time after you play an occupation after this one, you get 1 building resource of your choice.",,,
E164,,Mountain Plowman,,,,山の耕作者,与锄系搭配即可获得羊繁殖套装。,"Each time you plow at least 1 field tile, you get 1 sheep for each field tile that you just plowed.",,,
E166,,Roastmaster,,,,肉焼き名人,如果有調理場就是能做出+2飯的工作量，但若是拿了調理場後又反覆去漁小劇，手效率就會稍微變差。請和能發揮牛作用的卡搭配使用，盡早讓牛繁殖。,"Each time you use the ""Traveling Players"" or ""Fishing"" accumulation spaces, you can move exactly 1 food from that space to the other to get 1 cattle.",,,
E167,,Dairy Crier,,,,酪農家,把获得的羊或牛用于繁殖吧。想在别人准备好灶台/烹饪场或家畜栏位之前先打出来。就算在家畜为0的状态下打到5ステ，最终也会变成羊4牛1，所以效果也还算不错。,"When you play this card, each player (including you) can choose to get 2 sheep or 2 food; you also get 1 cattle.",,,
E168,,Animal Tamer's Apprentice,,,,見習い調教師,即使进行多次扩建，也能获得大量的家畜。与在回合结束时扩建的周日木工非常契合。,"At the start of each round, you get 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle for each unoccupied wood/clay/stone room in your house.",,,
