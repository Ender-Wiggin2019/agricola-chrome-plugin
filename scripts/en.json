However, their mere presence affects the game\ntremendously, because it means that there is always always an incentive to deny your opponents from a resource\nthey need but you don't. While often this implicit threat is never followed up\non, the threat is always there. Although the Pottery can be very strong in larger\ngames, I've found the Basketmaker's Workshop to be the best overall. The extra\nfood per harvest is important when it comes to justifying the action used to\nbuy it. In 2-p, it is sometimes possible to deny your opponent reed for the\nentire early game, shutting down their family growth. The Reedery is an\nexcellent way to actually use that reed.

For instance, rather than spending 1A on 3 stone and 1A on\nMajor/Minor to get a well, you can just plow 2 fields. 2) You can wait until much later to renovate.

      "insight": "There are two things that drive the early game: the battle for 5W and 2R, and the fight for the early fireplace. Winning the fireplace race is a boon, as it can singlehandedly ensure a windfall of early game mutton. Your opponents will be forced to watch the sheep pile up, knowing that the moment they make a move towards acquiring them, you will snatch them up. And so, oftentimes, no one no one will do anything toward acquiring them, instead fighting amongst each other for other early game sources of food. And the sheep will continue to build up, doomed to eventually be cooked in your kitchen. There are two things to be careful of. The first is that occasionally someone to your left will take SP, inadvertently giving one of your right-hand opponents a 2-action window to build fences/cookery and then snatch them up. The second is if an opponent has one of the few improvement cards that can break your choke-hold (Animal Yard and Simple Fireplace are both good examples). As such, the early fireplace is an interesting exercise in risk assessment. The longer you wait, the bigger the reward, but the greater chance that the games inherently chaotic nature will let your sheep escape to someone elses farm. In most games, the 3-clay fireplace is usually not worth the buy. The main power of the fireplace is not for its late-game staying power (barring strange games where you manage to only feed on sheep, you will usually want to upgrade to a Cooking Hearth), but for its strategic early game value. The exception to this is 2-p games, where clay is tight enough to make a 4-clay grab pretty much a pipe dream. Moreover, animals are tight enough that if you dont eventually buy some animal cookery in a heads up match, your opponent will become flooded with readily available food. If you find yourself with a fireplace, its often worth making the upgrade to a Cooking Hearth. However, there are certainly times when secondary food sources like the Well will be able to let you subsist entirely on sheep. The three clay fireplace is a three star card, while the two clay fireplace is easily a five star card. The rating below reflects an average of the two.",

In order to get the most out of the card, you're going\nto need to play him and sow in Stage 1. The reason for this is that you cannot\nafford to loan him 3 wood in stage 2, since you need to be building rooms for\nfamily growth then. By stage 3, the extra wood will probably be coming in too\nlate to be relevant. So let's say you set out to play him in stage 1. You're going to need to take\nwood (never a problem), play him, and sow. But wait! If you're only using the\nsow to plant your 3 wood, you're using your actions inefficiently. Just compare\ntaking 3 wood three times to playing him, taking three wood and sowing. One\ngives you the wood now and denies your opponents, the other gives the wood much\nlater and lets your opponents have free reign. So in order to make the card\nmore efficient, you're going to need to sow something else. This is a minimum\nof 2 more actions. Devoting so many actions to this plan ahead of time\nrestricts your ability to adapt to your opponents. If the starting player\ninexplicably passes on 2 reed, for instance, you're going to have to let it go\nby as well, instead spending one of your actions to further develop your cute\nlittle wood engine. The card is also limited by the number of harvests (6). You're never going to\nbe able to sow wood on this more than twice. One neat trick is that the wood remaining on the card at the end of the game\ncounts towards the Joinery, even if you haven't harvested yet. As a result, you\nshouldn't be too worried about getting more wood on the card after all of the\nwood comes off the second time - just keep the wood until you plow and sow, and\nyou'll have 9 wood ready to be converted to 3 VP at the end of the game.

Often they won't and\nwill gleefully play their TP occ, not realizing that they're screwing\nthemselves just as much as they're screwing you. The exceptions to this are the\ndancer and puppeteer, which can really wreck the Juggler's day. Early on the\nDancer takes TP a lot, preventing the square from building up. Later, when the\nDancer's ability isn't as impressive, the Dancer will stop taking TP in the\nhopes that the Juggler will deliver 1 or 2 extra food. The puppeteer wants\nother people to take TP, and the Juggler guarantees that TP will be taken\noften. For him, the extra food is just an added bonus to something he probably\nwanted to do anyway. As far as comparing him to the fisherman, there are more TP occs than Fisherman\nimprovements, which reduces his value somewhat.

On the other hand, the Early Lover is\nstuck with his 2 room house - he's going to need 10 wood and 4 reed before he\ncan grow his family again. If he decides to eschew further 'fair' family growth\nand wait for 'Family Growth without Room,' he suffers from the fact that his 2\nroom house is pretty much unsuitable for renovation - there just won't be many\npoints in it. The final weakness is that playing the Lover early puts a giant bulls-eye on\nyour head. If your opponents are strong, they will be looking to screw you out\nof food at every possible avenue. That said, what makes the Early Lover strong is that while he is scrambling for\nfood, he is also using his extra actions to take resources off of the board.\nThe result is that while his farm might not look all that impressive, no one\nelse's will either! Pretty much everyone will be gimped by the Lover's\ninefficient scrambling, and by the end the Lover himself usually comes out\nahead. Playing the Lover on turn 2 is an all-in play - you are either going to win\nbecause of the play or lose because of it. An interesting alternative is to\nforgo playing him until around stage 3. Usually by this time, you have grown\nyour family once and have some sort of a food engine up. Hopefully, you can\nthen grab either 3 sheep or a piled fishing spot and use it to play the card.\nUsed this way, the Lover is safer and still a strong play, but doesn't have the\nswingy potential that playing him early does.",

Furthermore, there's no\nnon-idiotic setup that lets you fence 7 pastures. Try it; it just doesn't work.\nSo if you play the Manger, it's with the intention of going all-in and fencing\n8 or 9 spaces. This strategy requires a ton of wood that you're\nusually not guaranteed to have by the end of the game, so it can be risky.\nWhether you're fencing 8 or 9 spaces, you need a minimum minimum 14 wood - 12 to fence either a 3x3 or 4x2\nsquare, and 2 to play the manger.

The idea behind the Mendicant, it is being proposed, is that it will\ngive not only one, but likely all of these things, simply by merit of the fact\nthat it allows one to advance play by an entire action and, thus, an entire\nround. The disconnect between this proposed concept and your interpretation\nthereof seems to be a disjoin between the abstract and the demonstrable. Usually, when speaking of choices in this game, it's practical, or at least\nfeasible, to reference what's been gained based on a choice. Building early\nstables, for example, lets you breed sheep for food. Double plow and sow before\nthe first harvest can get an early grain engine going. And so forth. In this\nsituation, however, it's counterintuitive to be specific when speaking about\nthe Mendicant and what benefit, direct or indirect, it may or may not offer if\nits 'food loan' is exercised. The Mendicant's loan does not offer sheep or\nfamily growth, per say. Instead, abstractly, it offers pace pace . Pace is the most precious resource in Agricola. It is amorphous, undefined. Yet\nit undeniably exists, and exerts its influence upon every round, upon every\naction, from start of game to end. Pace largely (though not entirely!)\ndetermines who gets their food engine going sooner, who gets their house\nenlarged sooner, who gets their family grown sooner. It determines who has time\nto spare to gather particular, specific resources and who does not. It\ndetermines who has time to fiddle with Start Player due to a surplus of pace;\nor, it determines who is compelled to fiddle with Start Player to accommodate\nfor a lack of it. In a passive-interaction, economic competition game, pace is\nking. The Mendicant is unique insofar as it offers an opportunity that no other card\ndoes. It gives the player a choice, a meta-game choice, to decide to gain gain early game pace at the expense of\n(presumably) late-game pace. It offers this power just by merit of sitting in\nthe owner's hand; the option is exercised first, the cost (i.e., putting out\nthe card) is paid later. In your observation, you critique the player for choosing not to eat his grain\nand vegetable, by merit of the supposition that he could simply replace them in\nthe next round. The counterpoint is that by exercising the Mendicant option, he\ndidn't have to take the time to replace the grain and vegetable. Instead, he\nimmediately went on to the next step in his plan, which was to use these\nresources to launch his food engine. He advanced along his intended strategic\npath, rather than repeating or, worse, regressing upon it. He gained pace.\nPerhaps in fact he merely gained a single action. But this single action can be\ncrucial, critical. Surely you have played often enough to have a fireplace\nsnatched from your fingertips, to have animals slaughtered in someone else's\nkitchen rather than your own, to be ready to enlarge your home or grow your\nfamily only to see yourself unable to do so for want of a single, extra action\nahead of an opponent's. Now instead think upon the games wherein your position\nwas well enough laid out, your pace ever so slightly ahead of the pack, that it\nwas you, and not them, who got that first family growth, forcing them to wait\nanother round to grow theirs whilst you enjoyed the fruits of your labor. The\nMendicant in your hand helps you to ensure the latter to occur more often than\nthe former. And the effective is cumulative, arguably. The Mendicant saves us an action,\ninherently -- the action of collecting two food. Instead, that action is spent\non something more beneficial to short-term strategy, such as collecting reed or\nwood for building a home extension. This in turn could lead us to growing our\nfamily one round earlier than we would have otherwise been able to. By growing\nour family one round early, we've now gained *another* action. That action,\ntoo, sets our pace forward more rapidly, eventually letting us again expand our\nhome and grow our family earlier, netting us still yet another action. Pace is\nself-perpetuating; it is exponential in its rewards. And the earlier the seed,\nthe more bountiful the harvest. And all of this pace acceleration has a strong, I would even argue devastating,\neffect on the rest of the players. The extra action(s) you gained can be used\nto gather pace-related resources. More resources for you means less for them;\neven snatching a simple stack of 3 wood is enough to ruin another player's\nplans of family growth for who knows how long. Whereas, the players who have to\nscrounge around on the Day Laborer space are simply leaving those resources\naround for others to take. That's an enormous swing in the early game. Indeed: it was just this sort of swing that spawned the discussion from which\nthis thread emerged. Someone expended their 'extra' Mendicant action to take\nthe sheep away from another player. That player's game was devastated. That\nplayer (a) had to waste his last action; (b) still took a horrid amount of\nbegging negatives; and (c) now *still* has to scrounge around for sheep to get\nhis food engine going for the next harvest. His pace was shredded. The\nMendicant holder's pace was hardly affected. That's an amazing boon. That said, the Mendicant is hardly a powerhouse. You're not going to\nwant to play this every time - just when a very juicy opportunity presents\nitself. Moreover, a smart player is going to see you take those 2 begging cards\nand immediately know that you plan on Mendicant'ing your way out. Especially if\nyou're in 2-p, she might then try to block the occupation square in the last\nround to blow you out",

Finally, wood reduces in value of the course of the game, so\nthat by the final round it's not worth nearly as much as it was in stage 1. Often, the food cost implies that you will have to\nspend an extra action gathering food in stage 1.If you compare playing Private\nForest and then taking Day Laborer to just taking 3 Wood twice, the latter is\nclearly superior.

The Wet Nurse has\nthree weaknesses: 1) It lets other players use the FG spot. 2) The extra food cost is very significant when you are also doing FG. 3) No minor improvement. If you only use the Wet Nurse's ability once, you spend 2 actions (1 for the\nOcc, 1 for the build rooms) and 2 food. This is pretty much strictly worse than\nthe regular path, which spends 2 actions (1 for build rooms, 1 for minor\nimprovement) and no food, and gets you a minor improvement. So in order to get your money's worth, you're going to need to use the ability\ntwice. In that case, you're spending 3 food and 2 actions when you could be\nspending no food and 3 actions, getting 2 minor improvements along the way.\nAgain, this is not a great trade. What makes the Wet Nurse actually playable is when you can use her to get FG\nearlier than you otherwise could. In that case, you are actually conserving 1\nor 2 more actions than the analysis above would indicate. However, I've hopefully indicated that the Wet Nurse does not speed up your\nfirst family growth much, if any, because you have to spend a turn playing the\nWet Nurse. Saying, 'she prevents me from being blocked' is not a very good\nargument because she also prevents you from blocking someone else! One very\nvalid point is if the FG spot comes out late and you are on the ball on\nresources, she definitely can help to speed up your first FG. But if the FG spot comes in the first or second round of stage 2, the only way\nthe Wet Nurse will be actually 'broken' is when she speeds up your second second FG. For this, several things have to\nhappen. A) She has to be get the resources necessary to build 2 rooms. B) She has to have enough food to use the ability AND feed the offspring. C) She has to meet conditions A and B relatively quickly. If you are letting one of your opponents get 10 wood, 4 reed, and plenty of\nfood in the early game, chances are you're not losing because of a broken\noccupation. That said, she's still almost always worth playing, and you should be happy\nwhenever you draw her. While she's unlikely to win you the game by herself,\nshe's certainly a good start.",

      "insight": "There are two things that drive the early game: the battle for 5W and 2R, and the fight for the early fireplace. Winning the fireplace race is a boon, as it can singlehandedly ensure a windfall of early game mutton. Your opponents will be forced to watch the sheep pile up, knowing that the moment they make a move towards acquiring them, you will snatch them up. And so, oftentimes, no one no one will do anything toward acquiring them, instead fighting amongst each other for other early game sources of food. And the sheep will continue to build up, doomed to eventually be cooked in your kitchen. There are two things to be careful of. The first is that occasionally someone to your left will take SP, inadvertently giving one of your right-hand opponents a 2-action window to build fences/cookery and then snatch them up. The second is if an opponent has one of the few improvement cards that can break your choke-hold (Animal Yard and Simple Fireplace are both good examples). As such, the early fireplace is an interesting exercise in risk assessment. The longer you wait, the bigger the reward, but the greater chance that the games inherently chaotic nature will let your sheep escape to someone elses farm. In most games, the 3-clay fireplace is usually not worth the buy. The main power of the fireplace is not for its late-game staying power (barring strange games where you manage to only feed on sheep, you will usually want to upgrade to a Cooking Hearth), but for its strategic early game value. The exception to this is 2-p games, where clay is tight enough to make a 4-clay grab pretty much a pipe dream. Moreover, animals are tight enough that if you dont eventually buy some animal cookery in a heads up match, your opponent will become flooded with readily available food.

      "insight": "There are two things that drive the early game: the battle for 5W and 2R, and the fight for the early fireplace. Winning the fireplace race is a boon, as it can singlehandedly ensure a windfall of early game mutton. Your opponents will be forced to watch the sheep pile up, knowing that the moment they make a move towards acquiring them, you will snatch them up. And so, oftentimes, no one no one will do anything toward acquiring them, instead fighting amongst each other for other early game sources of food. And the sheep will continue to build up, doomed to eventually be cooked in your kitchen. There are two things to be careful of. The first is that occasionally someone to your left will take SP, inadvertently giving one of your right-hand opponents a 2-action window to build fences/cookery and then snatch them up. The second is if an opponent has one of the few improvement cards that can break your choke-hold (Animal Yard and Simple Fireplace are both good examples). As such, the early fireplace is an interesting exercise in risk assessment. The longer you wait, the bigger the reward, but the greater chance that the games inherently chaotic nature will let your sheep escape to someone elses farm. In most games, the 3-clay fireplace is usually not worth the buy. The main power of the fireplace is not for its late-game staying power (barring strange games where you manage to only feed on sheep, you will usually want to upgrade to a Cooking Hearth), but for its strategic early game value. The exception to this is 2-p games, where clay is tight enough to make a 4-clay grab pretty much a pipe dream. Moreover, animals are tight enough that if you dont eventually buy some animal cookery in a heads up match, your opponent will become flooded with readily available food. If you find yourself with a fireplace, its often worth making the upgrade to a Cooking Hearth. However, there are certainly times when secondary food sources like the Well will be able to let you subsist entirely on sheep.

Since nearly every good endgame strategy involves sowing vegetables at least once, this is usually worth playing. Don't get me started on how silly this card becomes if you have an occupation that provides early vegetables. The card is interesting to compare to the Planter's Box. On one hand the Planter's Box is clearly a stronger and cheaper card. However, Potato Dibber can be played in the early game, and being able to play Dibber to set up an early 2R grab can be crucial. The fact that the two improvements are roughly equal in my book speaks volumes for how much timing affects the value of minor improvements.",
