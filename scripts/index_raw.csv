Select one of them randomly, which you can play immediately without paying an occupation cost.",,,在一动卡里算是比较弱的那一档。毕竟三选一的条件太苛刻了。一动卡你最希望一动卡做的一件事是在你需要打一张次发的时候也次发可以打，而非在你一个固定的时刻打出它。这个是通常不值得的。这个你前期可能你生娃的时候时间很仓促，什么也准备不好，你这时候有一张卡可以打，这时候你打一张拆信刀，很可能就会随机到一张你并不想打的卡。所以他的综合收益是比较差的动。

A039,礼拜堂,Chapel,T1,,A,"This is an action space for all. A player who uses it gets 3 bonus points. If another player uses it, they must first pay you 1 grain.",,,算是一张在A到S之间的卡牌。收益比较简单，可以理解为就是每回合打出来超额收益一分，此后每回合超额收益一分。它通常来讲是可以发动六次的，所以它有一个七分左右的总收益。同时你还可以围绕他去做一些构筑。你手抓获得他有信息差的情况下，只要不要倒霉的撞到啤酒池之类的卡，这张卡的收益还是很高的。算是一个强A到S之间的卡。
A040,陶艺家的庭院,Potter's Yard,T1,,C,"Immediately place 1 clay on each unused space in your farmyard. Each time you turn a space into a used space, you get the clay and you can immediately exchange it for 2 food.",,,算是一张B到C之间的卡，放在C的最前面。这张卡理论收益是4饭，非常强大，可以说是和书架在一个级别的收益。它有一定的灵活性。它需要配合的卡就是比如木贸，你只要是七个空地，通常来讲就是说你需要占用八个空地的话，房子你只要起四个马厩的卡组都可以使用它。然后很早去犁到六块田的卡组也可以使用它。同时一些需要围两次的卡组也可以使用它。
A041,蔬果刨刀,Vegetable Slicer,T2,,C,"Each time you upgrade a Fireplace to a Cooking Hearth, you immediately get 2 wood and 1 vegetable (not retroactively).",,,比较弱的一动卡。算是一个很弱的种子卡。看你需要一个菜的时候你可以抓他。但是有时候你如果过早的抓它，你后面不需要火炉就很尴尬。就是天时地利人和的情况下还是比较强的，通常情况下不是那么强大。这张卡基本基本没见有人能用出来过。唯一的操作可能就是配合畜牧教师加法救工人。太苛刻了，一般没啥用。

With 7 or more wood, you must do so.",,,价值大概是在一个A级里面比较弱的位置。它的价值完完全全的取决于就是你前期究竟要花多少饭。因为他的这个兑换效率放在后期来讲是不算很高的，一个木头兑换三口饭，这个效率在后期超额的有限。他主要的收益就是在前期，你究竟能够把多少根木头兑换成饭。因为在前期木头基本上相当于一半，你前期每使用一次刨工台你就相当于净赚了两饭收益。刨工台在前期是指在前三季，在前三季刨工台如果能够提供到六饭收益的话，他就是一个强B卡。如果能提供到八饭收益的话，他就是一个强A卡。如果能提供到12饭以上收益的话，那他有S卡的水平。但是12饭的收益基本上就意味着你是有多个木头的消食物的消耗卡，比如箩筐加树农这种比较少见的情况。通常情况下把它是一个B卡的水平，取一个平均放在A卡里面。

A059,马铃薯起垄机,Potato Ridger,T3,,,"Each time after you harvest 1+ vegetables, if you then have 3+ vegetables in your supply, you can turn exactly 1 vegetable into 6 food. With 4+ vegetables, you must do so.",,,
A060,东方火炉,Oriental Fireplace,T3,,B,"At any time: Vegetable → 4 Food; Sheep → 3 Food; Cattle → 5 Food ""Bake Bread"" action: Grain → 2 Food",,,强度：算是一张核心的食物卡。你有它之后，你可以用羊获得大量的食物。你抓了它之后，你后面就可以考虑这些食物的用途了。前期围绕着它，你可以获得除了羊之外，包括菜和牛也有一些配合所在。你可以用它在全局收益到十个食物以上。然后只不过他需要的配合就是他和刨工台相比，他第一个是来的比刨工台慢，没办法配合特别早期的食物消耗。它需要配合第二季，他在第二季开始才有食物可供消耗。但是你在第二季以后，它可以提供通常可以提供十个以上的食物。所以他是算是一张B级的核心卡，能够提供大量食物的核心卡。
A061,簸谷机,Winnowing Fan,T3,,,"After the field phase of each harvest, you can use a baking improvement but only to turn exactly 1 grain into food. (This is not considered a ""Bake Bread"" action.)",,,

A064,大麦磨台,Barley Mill,T4,,F,"In the field phase of each harvest, you get 1 food for each grain field that you harvest.",,,低配垄作。他的麦子转化效率太低了，约等于每个麦子多给一口饭。这个效率实际上是在麦子转化卡里算是非常低的。可能只有那一张能把麦子当建筑资源用的不太强的卡能跟这张卡组配合。正常麦子本身就已经转换成饭了，意义不大。
A065,捆装种子,Seed Pellets,T2,,D,"Each time before you take an unconditional ""Sow"" action, you get 1 grain.",,,小于一动。它要求太苛刻了，特别要求特别苛刻。大部分情况下也就给一个麦子，给两个麦子的情况下他才算是一张合格的卡。给一个麦子的话挺一般的。就是没有什么能抓的时候勉强能一抓。
A066,喂食盘,Feeding Dish,T3,,,"Each time you use an animal accumulation space while already having an animal of that type, you get 1 grain.",,,
A068,芦笋礼物,Asparagus Gift,T2,,,"Each time you build a number of fences equal to or greater than the current round, you immediately get 1 vegetable.",,,
A070,起重机,Lifting Machine,T4,,F,"At the end of each round that does not end with a harvest, you can move 1 vegetable from one of your fields to your supply. (This is not considered a field phase.)",,,基本没有用过，不知道它有什么用，非常奇怪。因为它一次只能收一块地，相当于每一季只能多收一块，这实在是太少了。所以只有在非常奇怪的情况下才可以用它。一般情况下是没啥使用空间的，被芦笋刀完爆。
A072,钙肥,Calcium Fertilizers,T3,,,"Each time you use a ""Quarry"" accumulation space, add 1 additional good of the respective type to each of your planted fields growing a single type of crop.",,,
A073,农业肥料,Agricultural Fertilizers,T3,,E,"Each time after you turn at least 2 unused spaces into used spaces in one action, you get an additional ""Sow"" action.",,,这张这张卡就是两马厩或者俩房子送你一次播种，这张卡的话中规中矩吧，因为毕竟播种这个东西，它的特点是很少需要连续去播种。大部分情况下，这个两次播种的间隔都是非常长的。这张卡通常就是认为有配合的情况下提供了资本，算是D和E中间吧，就是如果你能抓得起他那他算是一张能打的卡
A074,树洞圈舍,Stable Tree,T1,,C,"Each time you build 1 or more stables on your turn, place 1 wood on each of the next 3 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the wood.",,,这是一张在核心和这个有核心强度，也有单卡强度的一张卡。这张卡单卡强度一般认为是两根木头，算是一个可以接受的强度。同时或许还有卡马厩的一些操作。赌到配合的话，价值有四动。但是另一个角度呢就是这张卡它的强度高低非常依赖于你上家的玩法。就是说你上家如果是一个不喜欢扣卡的玩家的话，那他的强度还可以。如果你上家非常喜欢扣卡的话，那在234抓里看到的，他强度可以说几乎相当于零。竞技场环境下，这张卡在234抓的强度很少可以看得见。但是它本身的强度又不值得一抓。所以说综合来讲就很只有在很少的情况下你去抓其他卡才能够烂到让你去手抓一张这个卡。所以综合来讲的话，它的强度只能在C里面偏弱的强度，这是它的平均强度。

强度：这张卡没有配合的话，朴素上是一张不卡田的卡，并且赠送一定农业价值，算是略弱于无配合的耕帮。
难度：3/5
用法：最朴素的用法有前期播烤生娃，R12播烤超生，R13 犁播超生，R14 犁播*n 次。如果犁播被占了，还可以播烤跳犁播。注意第三四季要真实地播一次，第六季再播，发挥农业优势。搭配：赠送无条件的播种的卡如年幼农夫，强化或容易触发播烤的卡如新手学徒、吟游诗人，强化或容易触发犁播的卡如轮式犁、同桌。搭配种子卡一定可以第六季种下去，因此可以走农业卡。不搭：注意，不在自己轮次播种的卡如播种大师无法搭配偷懒播种工，农孩、二婚配偶这些本来就可以踩已被占据格子的卡也和偷懒播种功能重叠。田卡也功能重叠。",,

强度：没配合一般不考虑这张卡，有钓鱼配合的话有T2以上的强度。第一、二季的次发（尤其是R2-4的次发）用优雅的方式而不是抢先打出是很好的。
难度：3/5
用法：一般前两回合打出，R2和R4 末动要踩一次钓鱼，后续的钓鱼不用每次偶数回合踩，但是早踩打出关键次发是有利的。中后期有石头手段了去钓鱼偷主发。搭配：配合主发行动的卡如瓦匠，小商贩，钓鱼套卡牌，注意流网渔船虽然不搭：被敌方的渔网完克

难度：3/5
用法：要估算石头翻开的时间和你要打的卡，以及做出抢先、生娃的规划、多拿两张前期次发，少拿一张前期职业，不要冲突，最好用任务工打出关键卡，达到收益最大化。大部分情况下在第一季打出，偶尔可以在R5 或第三季打出。搭配：蓝图、手工艺推广等强化次发的卡，污水坑、餐具室等前期卡，提煤筐、心形石等依赖石头翻出后顺便打出的卡

难度：4/5
用法：这张卡由于没上线bga，所以用法很难说，体感有两种流派。第一种是三屋流，先R6左右生到一个，R7-11五回合中触发3-4 次，拿木头拿砖拿动物拿食物。其中1-2回合可以围栅栏、田、翻修、打卡这种。然后如果第五季超生一次，五六季有希望再触发1-2次，这就是勉强回本的上限分。另一种用法是4-5 屋流，一般到R11能生满就不错，然后 R11-14触发四次回本。搭配：强力食物手段如鱼叉，快速生娃手段如针线编制工，累积行动也能干活的手段如猪围、木护等",,

用法：有强势钓鱼卖艺组合或早菜需求才用。常见的是鱼叉或者魅惑。如果是鱼叉，就前中期打出后，中期拿2-3 次2鱼，拿到2-3 麦，后期钓1鱼，拿到2-5菜，播种只播种麦子，麦菜满分。如果是魅惑，第一季钓一次1麦，一次1菜，拿一次rsf 和一次羊，剩余的三动可以考虑2田播种麦菜，循环利用，然后r5 魅出来。搭配：强势钓鱼卖艺组合，如鱼叉、啤酒池、有临工套的少年艺术家，相当于送了满分麦菜；魅惑者等需要前期麦菜的组合",,

强度：抓人的随机应变卡，如果第一季可以拿到至少1w1f 就值得打出，期望收益略高于伐木工，有配合的话收益可以达到线人。我之前有一局森林犁木割，可以达到10w5f 收益，超过树农线人。
难度：3/5
用法：控木头累积格子，比如说丰收前一回合要把森林树林都扣了，这样子丰收回合可以留3w，2w。然后丰收前二或第三回合把林地扣了，丰收可以留2w或3w，掌握节奏。但是注意扣这些东西的时候不要影响自己的节奏，不然得不偿失。搭配：任何人的森林犁、木巡、林业研究、木护、篮子等留木头尤其是留2w的卡不搭：任何人的木推、采菇等多踩木头卡，任何人的森林科学家这种触发条件矛盾的卡",,
A105,手推车工,Barrow Pusher,T2,,,"For each new field tile you get, you also get 1 clay and 1 food.","效果：每当你犁一田，你获得1c+1f
强度：中后期的c急速贬值，大部分情况下基本认为一个c的价值在0.2-0.7 之间。按照0.5计算的话，这张卡就算5 田也只能给你带来5收益，但是如果只有2田就只有2收益了，算上打卡花的食物得不偿失。是上限可以碰到T1边，但是下限只有不足2分收益的方差较大的卡。
难度：2/5

难度：3/5
用法：没配合别打搭配：钓鱼人等给你主发行动的卡，讲桌、年幼农夫等加强主发格子、翻主格子的卡不搭：注意家具供应商给你的不是主发行动，而是你可以打出一张主发或次发，由于不带“行动”二字，因此无法触发",,

A115,首席林务官,Chief Forester,T4,,,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you also get a ""Sow"" action for exactly 1 field.","效果：每当你使用木头积累行动格，可以往最多1田播种。
强度：注意这个是有限制的播种，因此不能触发海藻肥等要求“无限制播种”的卡，所谓无限制播种就是不限制播种多少田，不限制种子种类，完全等同于“播烤”格的播种。这张卡要求你在拿木头准备围的时候，赚取播种的收益，基本相当于第二三四季播种+第五季的播一点点，并且加强了第六季的格子。但是其实你打这张卡的功夫，就可以踩一次播烤，往往是更赚的，因此单卡无价值。

难度：3/5
用法：第五回合如果没有别的超额收益的职业，且看到5 生局可以再打，并且你要保证你扩到5 屋能有翻、有田、有围、有饭不崩盘，那这张卡的收益你才可以吃干抹净。中后期要有横截木、士兵、手工艺推广等石头利用手段，多扣主发。搭配：加强生次、翻主、西矿场的卡，比如锱铢必较。最好要用围的手段，你扩3 翻2，又不依赖翻围，是容易丢围的，田园篱笆可以保护这一点。",,

A127,寄宿者,Lodger,T3,,,"This card provides room for one person, but only until the returning home phase of round 9. If, by then, there is no room elsewhere for that person, remove it from play.","效果：这张卡可以提供一个家庭成员的居住空间，如果你在R9 回家阶段仍然未给这张卡上的家庭成员提供居住空间，则将之永久移除游戏（也就是你后续也不能生到5 人口）
强度：这张卡的强度极其依赖你第一个娃生在第几回合，如果R9 生娃， 则无价值。每早生一回合，相当于你赚了一回合的晚扩房子，你赚了建筑材料的贬值的差价。因为前期建筑材料贵，后期建筑材料便宜，晚扩的收益还在于一次扩多间屋子，如R8 扩2-3 间。5 生局保底可以抢1生+省下一动扩屋，回本的水平。7 生局单卡不回本。
难度：4/5
用法：如果你确认你本来就想晚扩屋，那么这张卡就值得抓。比如说你第一季需要做农巡或污水坑的早农业，腌制工、收集者等的早畜牧业，或者你有木扩、支柱等晚扩省建材的卡，都值得你在R5 等时机抢先再打出这张卡，抢到一生。需要注意的是，小心R8-9的扩屋格子被别人恶意卡住。搭配：农巡、小户农、污水坑、木扩、支柱、黏土小屋建筑者等晚扩卡，羊生、麦床、奶妈等前期生娃卡不搭：情圣等超生卡，木贸、佃农、休闲木匠、流浪汉等一间间扩屋卡。",,

强度：毫无强度的一张卡，因为你要扩建屋子，需要芦苇，但是你却不能自己去除了R2的2r格子，这要求你中后期多踩rsf 才行，还要看别人的脸色，往往会因为别人都不踩芦苇池而最后一个生娃。
难度：5/5
用法：控制住rsf 格子，凑齐自己扩建资源的同时，逼着别人踩芦苇格子，然后你要在R4 前攒够扩屋资源，不然毫无强度，这要求了你的前期除了河岸建造工最好是家庭版，然后R3 打河岸建造。搭配：砌墙工、温馨家庭等要求一张张生的卡，别人家的啤酒池、河岸林务官等加强芦苇池的卡

强度：单卡只能提供2麦，而且要求前中期打出，不合格的下限分卡。这卡是要打配合或者抢生才有收益，如果可以抢到1生，就能回本。有配合的话，可以上调到T2及以上。这卡相对于佃农较弱，有两大原因，一点是麦子套（农巡、私教等）都不务正业，强行打流浪汉节奏容易末生。另一点在于，这张卡虽然相当于佃农可以造多个房子、造马厩，但是没有佃农的翻修用处广泛，因此抓位靠后。
难度：3/5
用法：这里介绍一下两种常见
用法：1.抢生：R4 你没有抢到首扩，可以在R4/5 越早越好打出流浪汉，然后尽早扩一间屋子，之后可以抢先拿到首娃或者次娃，可以拯救末生，如果手上有麦子配合卡，可以在扩第二间前打出即可。2.私教：私教打流浪汉需要多抓一些建材职业，比如说木贸、4w职业、拾柴、温馨、木床等，可以容易地快速打出人口压制，如果职业缺少省建材的则不推荐使用。搭配：木床制造工，快速生5 娃，温馨家庭，私人教师，农巡等麦子套。",,

强度：很简单，如果你本来就要打1工坊，这张卡就赚1动1饭，是2.5 收益，如果你本来要打2工坊，这张卡可以到7.5 收益，三工坊就是12.5 收益左右，这种情况下比乞丐学徒。但是其实，工坊本身都亏模，更何况你打出这张牌别人可能更倾向于抢工坊，因此我们分开考虑三个工坊。如果你抢掉砖工坊，付出的代价往往是翻打时没有合适的主发去打，那么可以认为是多花了一动，大概亏2分左右，如果你中期抢掉芦苇工坊，付出的代价大概是少扩一间屋子，也亏了1-2动，大概4 分左右。如果你抢木工坊，一般没人和你抢，只相当于亏掉2个木头，大概1.5分。那么终局来说，你可以用7.5 分换取12.5 分收益，净收益略大于5 分。但是你也因此获得了超过6 分的上限分以及信息差，你可以在轮抽时抓更多工坊牌。
难度：5/5
用法：轮抽时多抓工坊牌，石头牌，获得建材的牌，然后在打工坊时尽量用职业卡做到补齐下限，这样子在终局上下限俱全，容易赢得游戏胜利。在节奏上，我推荐第一季多拿rsf，生完第一个娃后打出这个职业，然后手扣一个工坊并翻打一个工坊抓紧兑现价值，最终在翻石屋时打出木工坊，那么至少需要3+2+2+2的石头手段。搭配：瓦匠、蓝图、切石等工坊手段，五金、处理者、箩筐搬运、树农等建材手段，杂货、制犁等中后期补下限卡EthanHuang: 注意，大陶艺工坊触发不触发技校导师有争议，从字面理解认为不触发",,

强度：1w1c的价值就算贬值到四五季，也接近1.5的下限分，此外这张卡显然有2分好拿的上限分，和3 分很难拿的上限分，总的来说大概是1.5 下限分+3 上限分，与牧场帮手的4 上限分在伯仲之间。
难度：4/5
用法：完美农夫发挥到最优状态的4-5 分，要么你要有收集者一般的海量动物，要么你要有贫农、摇摆步犁等卡利用剩余空地，不然完美农夫的第3、4 分要亏损空地分（因为你的圈地要缩小才能恰好装满动物）。因此完美农夫主要有三种打法：1. 13 木围114的6 格或15 木围116的8 格，然后填满两个面积1的圈地摆烂得2分。2.有足量动物手段时，可以15 木围6 格，怒刷3-4 分，8 羊8 猪8 牛，刷3 分的话只需要8羊5 猪4 牛。3.没有足量动物的话，12木围1111四格或者15 木围11111五格刷4-5 分，只需要8-10 动物，但是要有贫农、担保、摇摆步犁、豪华旅店等办法处理空地。搭配：动物卡、处理空地卡、田卡不搭：马厩卡、扩大圈地容积卡、有机农等要求少养动物的卡",,

强度：这张卡和畜牧士官不一样，很影响游戏环境，因为畜牧士官拿动物是刚需，但是拿建筑材料不是。因此很多人会考虑要不要去拿建筑资源而不是下限分，并且这张卡会降低工坊的价值，降低主要发展卡，让围更难了，是很卷的一张卡，利好没事干的玩家。保底是一张合格的4w卡，是回本的。
难度：4/5
用法：轮抽时思路一样，如果你在一二抓看到劳务士官，你要考虑拿到更多的高效得资源手段，高效获取下限分的手段，然后腾出空去刷劳务士的上限，这种情况你要前五回合打出来他。如果你在后抓拿到劳务士官，其他人可能有比你更强的高效得资源手段，这种情况你可以观察一下，而中后期再考虑打不打出他，R14打五分也是不错的选择。搭配：这张卡利好所有玩家的五金商店等高效得资源手段不搭：这张卡克制所有玩家的工坊流、主发流、士兵等资源换分卡",,

用法：必须要有强如首发鱼叉的卡，才能让他强度脱离白板，首发鱼叉的情况下，这张卡可以拿到5s1r左右。最好还得有强化卖艺的卡，如少年艺术家+房屋艺术家，再加上鱼叉，才有出场机会。应当是T4 卡。搭配：钓鱼套，卖艺套",,

强度：如果没有别人卡3f 卖艺的情况下，比木扩还要强。因为他虽然多花了四五根木头，但是多拿了6-9 饭，并且不卡扩屋格，是合算的买卖。也就是说可以认为是差不多木扩的强度，算是中等T1水准。但是实战中经常会有人第三回合踩卖艺，因此房屋艺术家过于限制玩家的行动，增加了玩家的风险，因此和木扩各有千秋。

to a Drinking Trough until you have at least 2 pastures. This is a significant
weakness, since early pastures are usually a bad deal. The reason for this is
that if you compare a single pasture to 2 stables, you can hold the same amount
of animals, but the stables can be built as a 'free' action when you
build rooms. The pasture, on the other hand, requires a full action on its own. That said, the Drinking Trough is still very
efficient at increasing your animal capacity once you have a couple of small
pastures up. While the improvement is often a mistake to play early, it can be
a nice play in the mid to late game if you haven't built stables yet.",
A016,夯实粘土,Rammed Clay,T1,,,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 clay. You can use clay instead of wood to build fences.","效果：打出时获得1c，围栅栏时可以用c当w 使用
强度：我们要注意一些问题。首先，牲畜一开 始的2 分是谁赋予的呢？是不是因为有居住环 境才会有人拿啊，谁也不会为了在房子里放一 只羊而前期拿羊吧。因此，我们合理的认为， 所有前期提供居住环境的卡，首先隐性地为每 种动物提供了初始的1 分，因为这让这些动物 的价值变得平滑，在前期就可以拿，而不是R6 再跟其他补元素的人抢，而居住环境提供的生 育价值我们暂时则不分析。那么，单独的居住 环境为单独的动物提供1 分，三个以上的居住 环境就有着3 分。而壁炉火炉则可认为是一个 单独的居住环境，并因此有着1 分的隐性收 益。因为有了它，你可以拿4 羊然后烹饪三 个，没有它，你只能扔掉三个。 栅栏的高效我们刚刚还提到，不过我们还要再 思考一下。首先，栅栏的直接得分不是围地面 积，而是圈地数量。而圈地数量也决定了14回 合独立动物的获取前提。首先你的房子提供了 第一种独立动物的居住空间，那么第一个圈地 提供了第二种，价值从2 分提升到了3 分，同 时考虑到一个圈地平均有2 格面积，那么此时 的圈地是5 分。第二个圈地提供了第三种动物 的居住空间，拥有着1 分居住分+1 分面板分+2 分空地分=4 分。而第三四个圈地，不再提供居 住价值，而只有着额外动物的边际价值，但是 这种边际价值往往下降，我们可以认为多余的 居住空间赋予了动物平滑的边际价值，而不是 多余的居住空间本身有着价值。那么第三个圈 地有着1 分面板分+2 分空地分=3 分。再考虑第 四个圈地时，木头不够用了，因此是1 分面板 分=1 分。因此圈地的价值大概是5/4/3/1 分， 而消耗的木头大概为6/4/4/1 木，我们可以发 现，木头在14 回合围栅栏时，拥有着1 木略低 于1 分的水平，而且拥有着极其平滑的性质， 让你可以先花大钱、再花零钱，基本上每一木 都能利用上，这是极其高效的。 回到正题，我们花费了14c换取了15 木，14c 的价值近似在7-10 分左右，强化为了13-15 分，收益在3-8 分之间。纵使夯实黏土会让c 增值，w贬值，也无伤大雅。

preventing yourself from being denied. Is the effect worth getting two grain fields sown

用法：这张卡一旦学会，是新手赢专家的最简单手段。没有扩屋卡的情况下最适合走2屋大农，这样来，前六回合的行动基本是固定的。每回合你优先一动拿3+的木头，2动拿田。如果偶尔拿不到木头，可以拿3+的食物熬过第一季。这样来，在R6前容易作出4田12木9围，在有栽培的情况下容易R5作出。在某些情况下，你可以选择为了拿3+羊而晚一回合打出大农庄，你也可以偶尔选择3田或5田。总之尽量不要晚于R6打出。如果在你想打大农的回合上家抢先了，不要吝啬一动用主发格子打大农，因为被卡了一回合大农就是2分的收益。在轮抽时，你可以多选择一些耗费食物的卡如杂货商，在打出大农后产生了价值。你最好在二三季拿到2+羊繁殖起来，这样到终局就是接近满分的羊，在3-5季，你要饲养第二种动物，才能拿到足够的动物分。如果你有足够的次要发展卡，可以在R11抢先，如果R12出的不是求子心切，就R12一动抢先。但是大多数情况下，你可以R11不抢先，而是R12一动抢先，更加稳妥。此外要注意的是，轮抽时在基础包中大农庄有很多配合，往往都在T4，要留意扣下，如瓶瓶罐罐、马槽、样板工（需要配合小户农），雕塑、羊毛毯、警官、栽培、板犁等等。搭配：超生卡如情圣，干草棚，扩屋卡如尊贵支柱，木匠，彻底重建，样例马厩建造者、2房卡如农孩、小户农不搭：任何第一季必须打出的卡，除了小户农

simple. Unfortunately, the huge requirement of wood (9!) prevents this from
being useful in the early game. If you're planning on using sheep for early

action? Absurd. One supposed weakness to the occ is that you don't get to play a free
Major/Minor Improvement. However, this isn't a valid concern. Let's compare
someone who renovates fairly and someone who uses the Conservator and then
spends an action on the Major/Minor Improvement space. The 'fair' player: Spends 2 actions renovating Spends about 1 action collecting 3-5 clay Spends about 1/2 of an action collecting 1 reed The Conservator: Spends 1 action playing the Conservator Spends 1 action renovating Spends 1 action playing major/minor improvement Even in this case the Conservator is better (he saves about half an action).
However, the Conservator has 2 additional benefits on top of that: 1) You don't have to buy the Major improvement if there is a more efficient way
of gaining points. For instance, rather than spending 1A on 3 stone and 1A on
Major/Minor to get a well, you can just plow 2 fields. 2) You can wait until much later to renovate. Because of the limited number of
renovation spots, the 'fair' player needs to renovate to clay fairly
early if he wants to get to stone. That means he also has to collect clay and
reed fairly early. The Conservator can just wait until the last possible
moment. I have played this card literally every time I've gotten him, and I'm pretty
sure I've never made a mistake in doing so. In competitive games where
resources are tight, he has singlehandedly won me the game by ensuring me a
stone renovation that otherwise would have been impossible. That's a good sign
of a five star card.",

强度：5-9分
难度：4/5
用法：这张卡虽然强，但是打出上限还是比较难的（注意，这里的上限指的是这局游戏获得的分数，而不是通过这张卡获得的分数）。轮抽时多拿一些便宜次发，或者是便于抢主发的卡。这张卡由于要打2-4张主发，打满次发，因此缺动，需要有高效补分手段。因此，千万不要拿强化弱动的组合，因为你动本来就少，比如钓鱼套、零工套等。搭配：瓦匠B095，蓝图C027，商人C096，切石A143，锯木厂，垃圾房，贫农D132等。
变体：这张卡推荐早翻，因为你踩发展卡格子打主发效率太低，但是晚翻的话，就没有什么好用的主发了，因此不太建议5房，三四房时提前准备砖头和石头，就要做翻修打炉/井的考虑了。一般三张主发，拿炉子、井、第二个炉子或工坊，是比较理想的。","Braggart 9 points? NINE POINTS! This card can easily win you the game by itself, and is the most common way
I've seen players score higher than 60 points. Harnessing the Occ's power is no
cakewalk, but when correctly played with the right combination of cards, this
is pretty much unstoppable. I admit my rating scale breaks down a bit here - if you only look at the
percentage of time he is playable, he is probably a three star card. However, I
give the extra star simply because of his raw power - he's engineered more flat
out blowouts and unreal comebacks than any other card I can think of. The card is also easily a 5 star card in draft, where you can tailor your hand
to include many cheap improvements.",

难度：4/5
用法：新手推荐在R3/4，R7，R10/11，R13/14踩，老手可以R3/4、R8/9，R13/14踩。关键点在于判断场上食物的充裕程度。与一般人对战还要考虑心理因素，一般玩家往往会在收获回合优先解决吃饭问题，因此可以在非吃饭回合用末动去踩卖艺，错峰田忌赛马，用劣动取得优势。搭配：新卡卖艺套不搭：琵琶演奏A160，木偶等哄骗别人卖艺套","Conjurer This is obviously worse than the seasonal worker, but not much more so. Playing

用法：根据我们刚刚的分析，这张卡最实用的 场景在于第一季早麦田流，中期扩生麦换菜， 第四季播麦菜，第六季犁播2 菜让农业满分， 需要强大的犁田系统。大部分情况下，做不到 上述这样的高收益，只能够麦换菜补2 分。 搭配：先农后牧流",,

难度：3/5
用法：这张卡不着急，便于你打前期配合，也便于你打2-3屋流，最愚蠢的打发是R4抢先打篷车，如果R5不出生就寄了。你前期安心发育，攒些资源和食物就行，等第二季R5-7抢先生，或者也可以先扩一间，等第四季抢先生第二个。搭配：2屋流 3屋翻修流不搭：扩屋流

miss-printed, allowing the player to plow an extra field once, not twice.
Depending on what your version is, this is either a must play improvement that
surpasses the Crooked Plow, or an underwhelming but sometimes serviceable play. As printed in my version, a lot of people
underrate this plow, which might have something to do with the fact that it has
'mold' in its name (ewww!). Still, think of it this way: if you value
plowing a field at one action and 2W at a little less than one action (3W for 1
action is usually the default), this is a good trade if you have nothing better
to do with your SP/FG. The lack of any prerequisites and somewhat useful effect
sometimes make it worth the effect. If you get two extra fields, the card becomes
fantastic, and better than the crooked plow. You're probably going to be
plowing twice during the game anyway, so at a bare minimum you are paying 2W

强度：这里再引入一个游戏意识，上限卡往往比下限卡更有用。下限卡往往指节省行动的卡，典型的是乞丐学徒，降低3分的得分上限，省掉很多行动。或者是给资源尤其是可计分资源的卡，比如给麦菜田动物的。而上限卡是帮你在计分表之外额外得分的卡，包括送分的卡，抢主要发展卡的卡等等。有机农本身如果建立马厩，可以拿到稳定的2-4分，但这2-4分提高的是上限，而不是资源，在终局竞争上可能比5木更有利，因为大家如果玩得好，都不缺围，那这样木头价值就贬值了，但是上限卡给的是实打实的分数，不会贬值。
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡有着两个内在矛盾，一是圈地完整度与马厩量的矛盾，因为木头就这么多，你很难造满15圈地和4马厩，就算你能造满，有时因为你没田往往要围八格，难以有效发挥有机农的4分。最优解是围6格，造4马厩，但是木头和田很难这么全拿到。另一个矛盾是动物数量和有机农得分的矛盾，如果你拿了动物的分数会降低有机农的分数，那么这些动物就不用拿了，因为有机农也会给你分，因此对局时可以降低拿动物的优先级，但也要各种动物都抓至少一次拿低保，如果按照上面说的围6造4马厩，或者有些养动物的卡（比如动物保护区），甚至还能养一两种动物。搭配：小麦饲养员，动物保护区等养动物卡，采矿锤，新卡皇家木头等马厩","Organic Farmer Is this hideous card subtle commentary on the futility of organic farming?

but not fantastic deal given that the wood is delivered over time and that
you're forced to use it on a specific thing. Given how rarely people actually
build 3 rooms in the first place (usually reed is too scarce), this won't come
up too often. If you only build two rooms, 4 wood for 1F1A is ok, I guess. However, the
4/3/2/1 wood occupations all give 4 wood the moment you play them, not just
when you build your 4th room (which, depending on how the game is going, might
take a while). Furthermore, the wood those occs give is no strings attached -
you're not required to use it to build rooms. In my experience all of the
4/3/2/1 occs are playable, but they're by no means must-plays. Since the
Carpenter is almost strictly worse if you're only building 2 rooms, he's
probably not worth it in that case. It's true that he can be used to reduce the cost of clay rooms and stone rooms
as well as Wooden Rooms. However, I think clay and stone rooms are mostly a
corner case - most rooms are wood, a few are clay, and almost none are stone
(the Well tends to be a much more efficient way to get points). Moreover, in
cases where you actually want to build clay rooms, clay is probably common enough

用法：配合用羊卡如织布机等可以考虑","Sheep Whisperer The best part about this card is the picture, which shows a dude using a
megaphone to 'whisper' to his sheep. Priceless. Unfortunately, like the Boar Whisperer, he's a decidedly underwhelming card. By
the time most of the sheep actually come, you don't even care anymore. He
needed to give a breeding pair before the second harvest to be playable. You're
better off spending the action building up your farm so that you can be the
first person to get a breeding pair of sheep.",

用法：我这里说两种情况，剩下的读者自己思 考，有问题随时回复。这张卡限制了你的犁田 位置，比如说5 房 4 田6 围，总应该从中间一列开始往下犁，这样 犁田的好处是，如果你没有新田这张卡，你最 多省3 木，如果从右侧犁，你需要犁满4 格才 能省3 木，从中间犁可以后期补田。再比如说4 房5 田6 围，此时你有2 种选择，从右侧犁田 或者中间犁田，中间犁田的好处还是3 田就可 以省3 木，但是右侧犁田虽然3 田只能省2 木，但是5 田时可以省4 木，看你规划什么时 候围，各有利弊。 配合：犁田卡",,

强度：这张卡与刚刚的面包托铲和打谷板不 同，他自己是有价值的，前期1f 接近1 分的价 值，而1 木只是略大于1 分的价值，这张卡本 身可以创造0.5 分的收益，因此轮抽时比打谷板 和面包托铲更适合抓。

用法：没配合第二季扩生时打出","Flail Flail When you're following the baking route, there can
be times later on where all you want to do is bake bread. In those situations,
this card can increase your efficiency, as plowing is pretty much always a good
action, whereas sowing requires empty fields. Unfortunately, this card suffers from the same
problem that the Builder's Trowel has - since you had to spend a half action
and a wood playing it, it doesn't really save you an action. Moreover, often
extra bake bread actions are unnecessary even when you're baking. However, the value of the the card definitely goes
up as you increase the number of players in the game. In 4-p and 5-p, it's not
uncommon to get blocked from the sow/bake spot, and this can be a great way
around this problem.",

效果：每季结束时，你可以用1f 换2 个不同的 建材，或者用1f 换1菜。
强度：一般我们会在四五六季买3 菜，然后在 第六季播种2 菜吃1 菜，也就是说终局有4 菜，花3 饭得3 饭。一般第一季打出会很大程 度影响节奏，因此我们用第二季打出来计算。 第二季花4 建材打出来，二三季花2 饭拿2 任 意建材，勉强回本。因此净收益只有变出来的4 菜，也就是不超过4-5 分。
难度：4/5
用法：两种打法，第一季打出或者第二季打 出，注意晚于第二季就不要打了，不然就亏本 了。第一季打出尽量不要扣2c打，要扣第2-4 回合的4c去打比较赚，然后注意第一季结束可 以是4w1r，R4 抢先打农仓，R5 正好扩。如果 是第二季打，提前攒好4c/6c以及木头，排队生 打。 搭配：蓝图 不搭：高费前期卡，如木头推车，链式犁 EthanHuang: 补充搭配：农仓这张卡否定了一 些前期卡，因此他适合前期能快速回本的卡， 比如森林审查员，家具商；此外农仓有着给菜 的特点，适合蔬菜刨刀，胡萝卜",,

效果：每次踩木头累计行动格时，额外获得2w
强度：一般来讲，打出这张卡时，第一间房子与本卡无关，因此你还需要准备两个房子10木+围满15 木，每次拿3 木的话要拿4-5 次，如果要造马厩，会多1-2次，如果打木工坊，又会多1-2次，那么，每次踩木头都省2木，剩下两房子和围的每木价值1分，一共得到8-10价值。打出时的3w和3 职业时机比较早，付出了5+分，因此总价值是3-5 分。
难度：3/5
用法：多拿点前期职业最好给饭的，多拿点木头配合，供应商、伐木、采莓都比较好，新卡里森林研究、护树等卡不错。在R3-6 打出木推抢先是比较好的节奏，如果你下家首扩了，那你第二季很可能抢不了先，那你可以R3-4 抓紧抢先，早点打出木推。","Wood Cart Wood Cart This card is barely break even after you take wood

强度：就算不考虑配合，也不考虑踩麦子比踩田容易，只考虑额外收益。拿5田是近乎必然的，相当于白得5麦，播种时分配3田种麦子，相当于白得11麦。麦子拿满分5分收益+3麦用于吃，可见至少有7分的水平。
难度：3/5
用法：毕竟是体系卡，难度不会低的。两种打法，第一季打或者第四季打。有麦子换分手段比如茅草卧室家酿啤酒烘焙之类的可以第一季打，播3麦田。第四季打就每回合最后一动踩麦子。搭配：茅草屋顶、卧室、家庭酿酒师、新卡一堆啤酒套装、烘焙师、栽培师不搭：任何犁田卡

been aggressively pursuing FG (and you should be!), you often won't have
anything relevant to actually harvest, making the Occ all upside. In that
sense, the card can sort of work like a Mendicant that you have to play early -

your opponents are working to deny you food. This will always be a conditional card, but in certain cases can be extremely

with having plentiful veggies AND fences with animals in them (but not too many
animals!) - an uncommon situation to find yourself in, barring unusual
circumstances. The best use of this improvement is when an
occupation like the Undergardener has given you a ton of veggies. Since you're
probably going to easily max veggies, it can be nice to convert your excess
crops into some extra victory points. The card can also be a clunky way to get
a breeding pair of cattle - just take cattle at 1 and then trade in your veggie. Usually, this will have a marginal benefit, at
best. Still, it's hard to argue with the price-tag.",

强度：这里要引入一个概念，长反馈以及短反馈，像伐木工那种开局打出 全局生效的卡是长反馈，必须前期打出。这张卡是短反馈，四五季打出就行。还有的卡立即获得资源，可以称之为超短反馈。一般我们认为，如果收益和成本一致，超短反馈强于短反馈强于长反馈。栽培师的强度大概是短反馈5木5饭左右，有着7分左右稳定收益。
难度：1/5
用法：基本上是三四五季打出，然后末动犁田，早耕搭配：用田卡（如田园篱笆，大农庄，碎石清理）犁田卡（如各种犁）种子卡（如无子嗣）用种子卡（如胡萝卜D079）不搭：2田流卡（如牧羊杖，马槽）
变体：讲几个套路吧。首先是栽培大农，有栽培的话，大农可以R5出，这个之后分析大农细说。栽培大犁，摇摆步犁可以2动犁6田，这样子建议三到五季早犁，早拿到6木6饭，然后要想办法开马厩或者其他方法养动物，因为圈地的占地面积变小了。栽培除草铲茅草，可以用栽培手耕3田，拿一个麦子，播下去除草铲分成三个，再出茅草。",,

难度：1/5
用法：不要被这张卡的表面蒙蔽，第一季的r比w更值得你去拿，因为你一旦w换了r，就损失一次2w，所以不用着急拿木头，多拿rsf或者2r吧，一次3w就够你扩屋的了，能扩早扩，尽量R3/4扩。搭配：栅栏套 马厩套不搭：佃农B087

强度：这张卡本身用1w换1分是不赚的，只有三个饲养空间有1-2分的价值，收益只有1-2十分可怜。在马厩套下，由于省了1w，可以达到2-3的价值。在某些特殊情况，如马厩规划师+马厩建筑家+休闲木匠 这种需要打满马厩 又不用踩扩屋时，可以达到省1动的价值，最高上限4-5分收益。

强度：理论上来说，三次触发 3 饭打 3 职业，相当于白送 3 动 有 6 分收益。但考虑到三饭给别人，而且自己不能踩卖艺，最高不超过 5.5 收益。而且有时只能打 2 职业，长反馈 3.5 收益，勉强回本。
难度：5/5
用法：这张卡是新手噩梦，往往出现 7 饭卖艺没人踩，甚至 14f 没人踩。有时你甚至用麦子换食物就为了白嫖打职业。或者因为花 1f 买了职业而踩临时工，或者因为扩屋卡迟迟不出则末生。我的建议是你要在轮抽时要观察，场上其他人的食物手段一定要少，自己的食物手段一定要多。如果你明明把陶瓷、鱼叉之类的放出去，或者烈酒放出去没回来时就要警惕，谨慎打木偶。木偶往往要 R3/4 打出，然后第一季踩 2/3 次 rsf 或者 4 饭钓鱼。尽量不要扣别的前期卡。

TP is taken is usually quite late, you're going to need at least one late-game

强度：三职业卡中几乎是最弱的一张，别的三 职业卡如“栎树林”、“工作证”、“木头推 车”都比这张强。我认为，三职业要求的卡往 往是亏大节奏的，因为他第一季的职业不好 抢，还花费了第一季的宝贵食物。打三职业可 以认为大概是首生变三生，亏了前期2 动也就 是4-8 分之间。马拉船如果在R5 打出，可以得 到9 回合收益，也就是13 饭左右，这个收益几 乎与成本持平了，可以看出本身是近乎无收 益、甚至负收益的。只有其他流派需要前期打 出3 职业时，才考虑打这张牌，那样子的话， 这张牌就有着13 饭减去2 木的大概4-5 分收 益。

难度：5/5
用法：这张卡本身限制了农牧，你必须在少量的生产资料的条件下获取大量可计分资源，比如卡牌的饲养空间，或者卡牌的田地。此外，你还需要用省下的行动去换取更多分数，比如用蓝图抢大量主发，或者家教灯笼吹牛等提高上限的卡。

been playing well, you might only have 2 or 3 unused spaces, and won't have
much food to spare. Still, if you have at least 3 unused spaces and plenty of food, he'll always be
worth the action. Potentially amazing if you are able to focus on Improvements

用法：这张卡用到上限的条件很苛刻，除了职业套凑凑人数外，最高的上限是自己一次动物都不拿，又踩到翻围，那适合什么情况呢？因为你要踩翻围又要养前期他们两次围给的动物，那你要前期早围一下，或者早打一个马厩。然后你，你想控翻围是要技巧的，数一下大家翻修够不够，不够的话你要抢R13的先，够的话也尽量不要末动，除非别人第五季就都石屋了，第六季没人抢你翻围。因此，这张卡要想清楚，而且准备好食物。搭配：先农后牧，上限卡",,

用法：这张卡要在第一季打出，货真价实的前期卡。轮抽时要拿2-3张各个阶段的木头次发，用于省1木，不要都拿前期次发（比如大温室，运粮推车），前期造不了这么多房子。在第一季时，要想好自己第一间屋子打什么卡，一般是火炉或者手上的前期次发，全局尽量不抢先。不要太贪，想着一次造2屋，容易被卡生。由于送2木，第一季应当更多的去拿芦苇，rsf是很好的选择，可以为第二间屋子打井做好准备。搭配：瓦匠B095，蓝图C027，垃圾房，建筑大师，石匠C087不搭：锯木场，木材专家，因为很少有这么多2个以上木头的次要发展卡
变体：提三点吧，首先不要因为想贪主发就扩到5，你没有木匠B126，木贸D119这种扩房卡就老老实实四屋翻修，留木头围。另一点是这张卡给15石屋更高的上限。。因为你在扩15石屋的过程可以打十三张次要或主要发展卡，这种情况不一定第一季出。最后一点，如果有瓦匠，一定要尽早扩五，搬空主发，亏动也要这样做，因为主发不等人。",,

don't bother plowing fields until stage 3 or even stage 4. In most games, you
won't have the time to plow fields early, and will need to spend most of your

take more grain every time you run out. While I don't play him every time I get him, he is a good incentive to go

B034,特色食物,Special Food,T2,,B,"The next time you take animals from an accumulation space and accommodate all of them on your farm, you get 1 bonus point for each of these animals.",,,是极其优质的分数，两分是它的基本收益，大多数情况下这张卡是一个无条件两分，而且他可以有四分的梦想，有上限有下限，愿不愿意为绕着他做就看后面的发牌，后面你发一张饲养空间卡，直接用它做到四分五分都是可能的，所以说这张卡总体收益还是比较高的。但是嗯这个也是一张环境卡，就是看环境里大家吃动物的意愿，如果环境里吃动物的选手比较多，或者做饲养空间的选手比较多的话，可能要降到一个C档，但是在环境里面比较正常的环境下的话，它也是有一个B挡的强度的。

your opponents options! Moreover, the benefit this gives you is just about as
dubious - even if you want clay, if you spend an action to play it and an
action to use it, you've spent 2 actions for 5 clay - that's pretty mediocre.
The choice to take 2 VP is fine fine , but usually you'll have a way to do that anyway, whether
it's by plowing fields or taking singleton animals to stay in your home. Overall, the high occupation requirement, zero VPs
and questionable benefit makes it one of the worst cards you can draw. The only
real use I see for it is as a desperation move in 2-p, after your opponent has
denied you clay.",

Certainly, in reports like this tournament thread tournament thread ,
he seems to be unfair. In the game, a player plays turn 2 lover and is able to
seemingly coast to victory. Without a doubt, the Lover is one of the best
occupations in the game. But is he broken? Playing the lover is pretty much impossible on round 1, so by 'early lover
action,' people generally mean rounds 2, 3 or 4, with the most infamous starts
coming in round 2. If you play it round 2, you're going to need to take
day-laborer once just to play it. Afterwards, you'll have either 1 or 0 food
and will need to secure 6 food by the end of the harvest. This should take at
least 2 more actions. What does this mean? You've spent 4 actions to get 2
actions before the first harvest! Another weakness with the Early Lover is that his house is still 2 rooms! A
player who grows his family the old fashioned way has the option of building a
4th room to his house and growing again. On the other hand, the Early Lover is
stuck with his 2 room house - he's going to need 10 wood and 4 reed before he
can grow his family again. If he decides to eschew further 'fair' family growth
and wait for 'Family Growth without Room,' he suffers from the fact that his 2
room house is pretty much unsuitable for renovation - there just won't be many
points in it. The final weakness is that playing the Lover early puts a giant bulls-eye on
your head. If your opponents are strong, they will be looking to screw you out
of food at every possible avenue. That said, what makes the Early Lover strong is that while he is scrambling for
food, he is also using his extra actions to take resources off of the board.
The result is that while his farm might not look all that impressive, no one
else's will either! Pretty much everyone will be gimped by the Lover's
inefficient scrambling, and by the end the Lover himself usually comes out
ahead. Playing the Lover on turn 2 is an all-in play - you are either going to win
because of the play or lose because of it. An interesting alternative is to
forgo playing him until around stage 3. Usually by this time, you have grown
your family once and have some sort of a food engine up. Hopefully, you can
then grab either 3 sheep or a piled fishing spot and use it to play the card.
Used this way, the Lover is safer and still a strong play, but doesn't have the
swingy potential that playing him early does.",

E016,荆棘篱笆,Briar Hedge,,,A,You do not need to pay wood for fences that you build on the edge of your farmyard board.,,,"效果：木头系天花板
强度：这张卡给的木头实在是太多了。这张卡可以给就是整整八根木头。如果你为八的话，可以给八根木头，如果为六的话，可以给七个木。就是只要你不是五房加大理的情况下，经济一半都是老赖全的一张核心卡。它的使用率比手机版还要高，而且还不传递。你只要抓了几张卡的话，你后期就几乎不需要为木头而担心，你只需要考虑怎么样能够把这张卡做出来。做出来的情况下通常会亏一动，但是你在亏一动的情况下，你可以获得一个接近于股东的收益，至少是四动的收益。但这也是非常令人满意的一件事情。而且本身你对一个圈地卡组来讲，就是如果说你是晚回卡组，那你肯定不能指望你围完再去拿木头。所以说他在一个网页卡组里，他对那个副作用是非常小，它甚至可以认为是近战系统的一张卡。"
E017,撇犁,Skimmer Plow,,,,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"" or ""Cultivation"" action space, you can plow 2 fields instead of 1. Each time you sow, you must place 1 fewer good on each field you sow.",,,
E018,种子年鉴,Seed Almanac,,,A,"Each time after you play a minor improvement after this one, you can pay 1 food to plow 1 field.",,,"效果：五动核心卡
强度：这是一个五动核心卡，超级大核心只值五动的超级大核心。他和他的理论收益升级，当然一芦苇的这个成本的话，也是算是一张四分卡。这个经济提高是一样的收益，但是比经济比钢要难做一点。因为他必须作为第一个发展，他就是至少是第二个方向，他打字也就意味着你要在生娃前打够四个职业。这个还是比较难凑的，通常普通话这个是要亏生娃的顺位的。但是你打出他的话，你后面可以直接转五动，也就是说你生完亏一圈都是值得的，只是一个赚多赚少的问题。肯定是一个A级别的卡。但是收益的真实收益的话，那平均就是说真实收益应该是在2~4度。"

E022,客房,Guest Room,,,B,"Immediately place any amount of food from your supply on this card. Once per round, you can discard 1 food from this card to place a person from your supply in that round.",,,你抓他之后，就是你打客房就跟你家庭版拿一个首生这两件事收益是差不多的。但是家庭版的首生你不一定能拿到客房打出来一个是稳定性要好，你也不怕牺牲也不怕什么，稳定性要好。然后稳定拿到首生的话，基本上他的总体算是一个两动收益。所以他在B级里算是一张比较强的卡。你用它去获得一个娃，是要比你用一些不卡生的生卡去获得一个娃要来得更加方便的。
E023,养蜂场,Apiary,,,C,"At the end of each work phase, you can sow exactly 1 crop on 1 field.",,,一般来讲是赚两动，就是没有特殊配合的情况下。但是但是他这个四直接打出条件，前期想要完成，就是在第一个收完前想要完成同样还是有难度。但是完成的情况下给两动。总体来讲就是因为他要求比较高，所以就放在C级。那如果这个这个要求低一点的话呢，它是可以有B级的。正常情况下他打出来的时间是在第九回合左右，你可以挡住他，挡下了他之后，他就可以给你一个两边的收益。但是问题在于第九回合不一定想要去打一张发展卡。除非你有什么速度增加之类的东西，这张卡的梯度可以适当上移。

At any time, you can discard 6 food from this card to build a major improvement at no cost.",,,这个东西就是六口饭换田。算是一张很好的核心卡了。他就是你只要前期饭多，你前期饭多你就可以相当于是一张四星卡。四星卡条件前期不缺饭，然后在大部分情况下都是可以拿的。甚至你围绕他去多拿点饭卡都可以。同时它在这个后期他还可以，就是你如果前期缺田的情况下，那你中期总不吃饭了吧。那你就用它去拿一些别人没人要的主发，从而你用这个东西去做出来一些奇怪的东西。比如比如最简单，它是可以配合那张柴火的，就是你在后期去打一些别人不要的烤炉。他主要是起到这个作品，就是有配合，而且单卡只要有饭他就能抓你。前期如果有一张爱宠或者什么之类的卡位，就直接毫不犹豫的可以把他抓下来。
E028,书签,Bookmark,,,E028,"Add 3 to the current round and mark the corresponding round space. At the start of that round, you can play 1 occupation without paying an occupation cost.",,,标准一动卡。在一动卡里算是稍强一点的位置，但是没有强太多。延迟三回合的限制并不小。

E030,儿童玩具,Child's Toy,,,,"During the feeding phase of each harvest, your newborns require 2 food (instead of 1).",,,"效果：两个卡
强度：其实所以一般都是在两个卡里比较差的。因为它的就是一次，那当然他给的是这个高贵的上下文。他几个优势，而且他一定要求打的时间比较早。另外一个是他底下的副作用是客观存在的。从平均来讲的话，他们也是要付出1.5万的代价，那排队收益不是很高了。如果你觉得这张卡，你其实可以参考一张丘陵宅院，觉得他和丘陵宅院的性质差不太多，就是成本差不太多，收益也差不太多。但是比丘尼怎样的适应性要好一点。毕竟就是也是一张你在收打的时候，你不想打卡的时候去打他的一张卡。"

E032,正厅,Nave,,,B,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each of the 5 columns of your farmyard board containing at least one room.",,,"效果：后期上限卡
强度：它和这个半路其实算是完全一样的性价比。就是它的净赚多少，你拿他打他，如果拿四出的话，那他其实净赚也就两分。两个十多个亿，芦苇本身值一分，同时你本身那样一个造型，造型上也要扣0.5分，就是俩石头一芦苇在里边就是值1.5分，一个造型上亏了1.5分。正厅这张卡通常认为就是净赚两分的一张卡，没有很强。但是它的好处是在于，就是如果你房子扩的比较高的话，你在后期实际上是有非常多的行动想要去拿一些上限。它是一张高贵的后期一张显卡。在这个情况下的话，他是要比这家室内装潢要强的。但是他同样还是那还是那件事，就是它是一张就是虽然他很值得抓，也就是说抓位还是比较高的。但是他的问题在于他的抓位虽然高，但他并不强。他你可以理解为他和客房一样，只是一个稳定性的手段，而不是强度。"

E038,鱼竿收藏,Rod Collection,,,,"Each time you use ""Fishing"", you can place up to 2 wood on this card, irretrievably. During scoring, each such wood is worth 1 bonus point, except the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th.",,,
E039,画笔,Paintbrush,,,,"Each harvest, you can exchange exactly 1 clay for your choice of 2 food or 1 bonus point.",,,"效果：上限卡
强度：这张卡的上限感觉还是蛮高的。这张卡的前提就是你要有猪，这个猪从哪里来比较关键。但是你哪怕第四期弄一头猪的话，他都可以用四个资源去换三份。你在就是四个资源换三分，关键是砖这个资源比较便宜。就是他和正厅这两张卡，可能级别是收益是相差不多的，就是都是资源成本和收益都差不多。正经很多时候也就四环完事了，因为他俩就是都是和和这个摆烂的三分画笔，都是一个水平。暂时画笔要比正经打的时间要早一点，就算是画笔一个缺陷。所以画笔的差不多是排在这个位置，算是一张不错的这个上限卡。"

强度：拿到田这件事情其实是有点高之。你能看到水沟就可能会去抽你的技能，仅仅说这样的话，这张卡如果能打出来的话，收益是挺高的。但是因为风险太高，这张卡不出来，所以这张卡总体就是只能排在这个位置。因为这张卡太容易被穿了，然后打的话扣三个时机也比较固定。你前期早期打不开局，那这张卡的时期基本上已经锁死在11回合了。因为如果11回合去一共抢一个骑士，你就会很难受。"

强度：它也是一张就是批判用的核心卡。它和去哪这三张卡我觉得比较像的，福小房间和东方火炉的。一个是要卖田来吃来给饭，一个是要你只要拿一个火炉来给饭。这个稍微贵一点，这就是这三张卡应该都是同一级别的，算是一张后期的食物核心卡。我觉得他的小房间的话一般就是要冲着装裤子，就是如果用小房间打折扣的房子，他可以说是无损给饭的，还是非常强大的。而且给的还挺多的，能给到十几口的话就很厉害。"

强度：就是走私货这张卡发动几次战的。就是你早期外发动第一次差不多是不赚不亏，你发打出来，发动第二次之后才开始赚。那他就是按强度就取决于你能够多快的能够打出发展卡。如果你打这个走私货之后连着这个连打一堆发展的走势都挺强大的。但是在大部分无法做到这一点的卡组里，这个走私货效果是，就他不太是一张能够连发的卡。就是正常情况下，你很难连续打这么多张发量卡。走私货总体没有裸照强度，大概是放在这个位置。"

E075,石斧,Stone Axe,,,A,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you can return 1 stone to the general supply to get an additional 3 wood.",,,"效果：石头资源
强度：这张卡经常的对比对象是路推，但是这张卡应该他的上限和下限都是要远强于路推的。从上线而言的话，石斧你是可以解锁很多石头卡的装备的，你是比如企业家之类的卡，如果你配合上石斧，他会非常强大。你可以抓非常非常多的石头卡，然后来用来配合石斧，他是增大你的灵活性，而不是减少你的灵活性。第二点是，它的收益是在于前期，RSF是一个非常非常非常强大的行动格，这个行动格的价值是不是2R和三木能比的，这个行动格的竞价值太高了。他唯一的问题就是在于石头不见得能用出去。在这个前提下，石斧提供了一个本sf的石头运出去的解密方案，所以石斧是一张非常非常强大的卡。你从下线的角度的话，他打出的条件要远比例最简单。上线的角度他有更多的配合，而且灵活性也是更高的。总体来讲，石斧是一个非常强大的A级卡。然后他哪怕在后期打出来，他有时候都足够强大了。就是在后期打出来的话，石斧的净收益都可以达到6米这个水平。"

强度：收益不算高，作用就是作用。其实小花招是没有别的作用小，但唯一作用就是换芦苇。如果小花招不是用来换芦苇的话，那小花招肯定是用亏了。然后你在换芦苇的情况下，他是不赚，但是能够稳定一下你的节奏的卡。有生的情况下想发招的效果非常苦。或许能有一张其他的声卡把声卡打CB，总体差不多是这个水平。"
