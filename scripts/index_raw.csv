A001,遮蔽所,Shelter,T3,,E,雨除け,拉栅后就是无成本1点卡。,"You can immediately build a stable at no cost, but only if you place it in a pasture covering exactly 1 farmyard space.",,,聊胜于无，复杂且收益低
A003,拆信刀,Paper Knife,T2,,C,ペーパーナイフ,连《农家乐》也到了能抽卡池的时代。需要精细步骤时不太好用，但如果是那种“有几张想在终盘前打出来的卡”的情况，这效果还不错。,"Select 3 occupations in your hand. Select one of them randomly, which you can play immediately without paying an occupation cost.",,,在一动卡里算是比较弱的那一档。毕竟三选一的条件太苛刻了。一动卡你最希望一动卡做的一件事是在你需要打一张次发的时候也次发可以打，而非在你一个固定的时刻打出它。这个是通常不值得的。这个你前期可能你生娃的时候时间很仓促，什么也准备不好，你这时候有一张卡可以打，这时候你打一张拆信刀，很可能就会随机到一张你并不想打的卡。所以他的综合收益是比较差的动。
A004,护壁板,Baseboards,T2,,,幅木,终盘SP→下回合栅栏、的动作很不错,"You immediately get 1 wood for each room you have. If you have more rooms than people, you get 1 additional wood.",,,
A006,储藏室,Storage Barn,T3,,,納屋,有“杂货店”等能大量获得石头的卡牌时，因为经常会拿取作为目标的大进步，所以更容易发挥作用。,"If you have the Well, Joinery, Pottery, and/or Basketmaker's Workshop, you immediately get 1 stone, 1 wood, 1 clay, and/or 1 reed, respectively.",,,
A007,菜农的割刀,Gardener's Knife,T3,,,園芸用ナイフ,只有小麦田的话效果不太理想，但如果也有蔬菜田就会大放异彩。,You immediately get 1 food for each grain field you have and 1 grain for each vegetable field you have.,,,
A008,食品篮子,Food Basket,T2,,,食材かご,在没有其他种子辅助时，能用1手就把两边都凑齐真让人高兴。,You immediately get 1 grain and 1 vegetable.,,,
A010,简陋木屋,Wooden Shed,T2,,E,板張りの小屋,扩建成本很优秀，但无论如何家点都会减少。若没有强力的盘外点，恐怕很难彻底拿下胜利。,"This card can only be played via a ""Major Improvement"" action. It provides room for one person. You may no longer renovate.",,,在大部分情况下，如果你房子少的话，你是希望拥有翻修的打卡行动的。如果你房子比较多的话，你是需要翻修的分数的。这张卡连上他本身少一个房子分，他的总亏损大概在三分左右。总收益是三个木头一个芦苇。如果在没有配合的卡组里是不赚的。但是在一些前期节奏比较紧张的卡组里面，简陋木屋可以为你提供就是相当于是一个前期行动。所以他算是价值一动的配件卡。
A011,泥巴地,Mud Patch,T2,,C,ぬかるんだ畑,即使只有1头野猪也有不错的效果。有2块田的话野猪会繁殖。用料理场吃的时候更容易发挥作用。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wild boar. You can hold 1 wild boar on each of your unplanted field tiles.",,,泥巴地就是很简单，没什么好评的。猪和它的饲养空间加起来刚好一动。
A013,翻修公司,Renovation Company,T2,,,改築事業所,与石屋连招或砖房增筑搭配使用。和修理屋的连招可以一口气变成石屋,"When you play this card, you immediately get 3 clay. Immediately after, you can renovate without paying any building resources.",,,
A014,工匠的铁锤,Carpenter's Hammer,T1,,B,大工の金鎚,以8木2葦、7砖2葦、6石2葦增建2间。因为是成本减免效果，所以有木工或家具匠小屋的话会更便宜。每次增建2间凑到6间比较稳妥。,"Each time you build at least 2 wood/clay/stone rooms at once, you get a total discount of 2 reed as well as 2 wood/3 clay/4 stone.",,,"一个木头打出效果，然后换取4~6个资源。在做违建的时候，每花费一个行动，再额外送你4~6个资源。
强度：这一部分效果大概是价值两动的，可以认为是一个价值两动的稳健卡。这个效果实际上发生的情况比较少。因为4~6个资源净赚也就是三个资源，不到两到三个资源，这个收益量实际上是不值得做违建的。可以理解为他为每个房子提供一个资源，这就是他违建的全部收益了。所以大部分情况下它是一个两动的稳健卡。"
A015,工匠的木斧,Carpenter's Axe,T2,,,大工の手斧,为确保繁殖空间，得分效率也以1木1分◎。若与厩相关卡牌组合还能更加活跃,"Each time after you use a wood accumulation space, if you then have at least 7 wood in your supply, you can build exactly 1 stable for 1 wood.",,,
A017,开荒犁,Reclamation Plow,T2,,C,開墾鋤,以农田为主推进时有点不好用的效果。终盘能确保获得1块农田。注意在家畜市场不会发动。,"After the next time you take animals from an accumulation space and accommodate all of them on your farm, you can plow 1 field.",,,稳健卡，给的很快
A018,轮式犁,Wheel Plow,T1,,,車輪鋤,成本比较低这一点很优秀,"Once this game, when you use the ""Farmland"" or Cultivation"" action space with the first person you place in a round, you can plow 2 additional fields.",,,
A020,双把犁,Double-Turn Plow,T3,,,畝立て鋤,仅仅做“1小麦→SP”这样的动作，和进两次田地差别不大，所以想和小麦补助搭配使用。有种屋的话，可以用“种屋→SP→小麦→播种”的4手做出2块小麦田。,"When you play this card, you can immediately plow up to 2 fields.",,,
A021,温馨家庭,Family Friend Home,T1,,,家族向け住宅,在增加人数的时机去增筑的话，就能拿到增员。有“日曜大工”的话会很亮眼。,"Each time you take a ""Build Rooms"" action while having more rooms than people already, you also get a ""Family Growth"" action and 1 food.",,,
A022,电报,Telegram,T3,,F,電報,在第6回合之前拉7根栅栏，并在该回合中打出的话,"Add 1 to the current round for each fence in your supply and mark the corresponding round space. In that round only, you can place a person from your supply.",,,卡我超生了，滚！
A023,石材公司,Stone Company,T1,,C,採石事業所,由于打出成本很重，所以不能说是好用的卡。进到2石里去收集井户和工業吧。希望在还有其他拿取马具屋等进步的好处的状态下运用。,"Immediately after each time you use a ""Quarry"" accumulation space, you get a ""Major or Minor Improvement"" action during which you must spend at least 1 stone.",,,算是一张比较弱的核心卡牌。他其实没有啥收益，你拿它去打很多主发有时候也赢不了游戏。但是它是有能够消耗你卡组非常非常多多余行动的一张卡。就是如果你觉得你这个卡组的多余行动比较多，你可以用它们来围绕这个食材公司做构筑。他的行动还是有一个基本的行动价值的，可以算是一个弱化的礼拜堂吧。然后当你去频繁的踩石头的时候，别人大概率可以进行主发。所以也可以算是一张比较弱的核心卡。在卡组适合的时候抓，他是能够获得三倍以上的收益的。
A025,摇篮车,Bassinet,T3,,,乳母車,,"Each work phase, you can place a(nother) person on the first non-accumulating action space used by any player (including you), as long as there is only 1 person on that space.",,,
A027,烤炉区,Oven Site,T3,,,窯置き場,与“贴砖”等的砖块辅助，以及“商人”“年轻农夫”等的进步辅助成套。炭烧工会很高兴。,"When you play this card, you get 2 wood and you can immediately build the ""Clay Oven"" or ""Stone Oven"" major improvement. Either way, it only costs you 1 clay and 1 stone.",,,
A028,林中私塾,Forest School,T4,,F,森の学校,因为会把1木转换成1饭，所以转换效率很差。即使职业格已经被占满，放进去的效果也称不上有多强，打出的成本也偏重，不好用。,"You can consider the ""Lessons"" action spaces not occupied. You can replace each food that an occupation costs with wood.",,,没啥好评的
A029,啤酒长凳,Ale-Benches,T3,,,ビールベンチ,1小麦=1点的转换效率还算不错，但给其他玩家发饭就不太行。,"In the returning home phase of each round, you can pay exactly 1 grain from your supply to get 1 bonus point. If you do, each other player gets 1 food.",,,
A030,烘焙盘,Baking Sheet,T3,,,パン焼き天板,1小麦转换成1点2饭在转换效率上很优秀。想做出能多产小麦的盘面。注意：必须至少烤1个面包才能发动。,"Each time you take a ""Bake Bread"" action, you can use this card to exchange exactly 1 grain for 2 food and 1 bonus point.",,,
A031,债务担保,Debt Security,T3,,,担保,还想准备其他优秀的得分来源。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each major improvement you have, up to the number of your unused farmyard spaces.",,,
A034,树枝剪,Loppers,T4,,F,剪定ばさみ,一次启动回不了本，所以想发动两次。最理想的形态是先拉7栅，之后再用6栅做出13根、6格的牧场吗。就算做到那一步，也不过是把3木转换成4饭2点而已，所以效果微妙。,"Each time you build 1 or more fences, you can also use this card to exchange 1 wood and 1 fence in your supply for 2 food and 1 bonus point.",,,没啥好评的，发动了也只是回本
A035,游泳课,Swimming Class,T2,,,水泳教室,虽然行动会稍微受限，但即使只发动2次也有4点份额就足够了。用养父母的话就不会发动了。,"In the returning home phase of each round, if you return a person from the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, you get 2 bonus points for each newborn that you return home.",,,
A036,表面雕刻,Facades Carving,T3,,,ファサード彫刻,想在终盘拉篱笆之前就打出来。需要木・砖・芦苇・饭等前期准备，行动会受到限制，但只看得分效率的话，比玻璃瓶还高。,"When you play this card, you can exchange any number of food for 1 bonus point each, up to the number of completed harvests.",,,
A037,木锯,Bucksaw,T2,,,大枠のこぎり,尽量发动2次吧。哪怕只发动1次也能用2木换1小麦1分，所以也算及格分,"Each time you renovate, you can also pay 1 wood to get 1 bonus point and 1 grain.",,,
A039,礼拜堂,Chapel,T1,,A,礼拝所,虽然是最强的行动空间，但如果不加思考地放出，就会被别人反复进去，反而成为输的路线。理想情况下是先在一定程度上增员、拉升版面分数，同时在中盘以后用多余的手番进入礼拜所。,"This is an action space for all. A player who uses it gets 3 bonus points. If another player uses it, they must first pay you 1 grain.",,,算是一张在A到S之间的卡牌。收益比较简单，可以理解为就是每回合打出来超额收益一分，此后每回合超额收益一分。它通常来讲是可以发动六次的，所以它有一个七分左右的总收益。同时你还可以围绕他去做一些构筑。你手抓获得他有信息差的情况下，只要不要倒霉的撞到啤酒池之类的卡，这张卡的收益还是很高的。算是一个强A到S之间的卡。
A040,陶艺家的庭院,Potter's Yard,T1,,C,陶工の中庭,从初期盘面开始只要填满6格就能打出。只要能顺利打出，无论作为食物补助还是作为砖块补助都是很优秀的效果。例如，可以在“2间增筑+2厩+2田”的状态下打出，然后拉上栅栏一口气回收砖块。,"Immediately place 1 clay on each unused space in your farmyard. Each time you turn a space into a used space, you get the clay and you can immediately exchange it for 2 food.",,,算是一张B到C之间的卡，放在C的最前面。这张卡理论收益是4饭，非常强大，可以说是和书架在一个级别的收益。它有一定的灵活性。它需要配合的卡就是比如木贸，你只要是七个空地，通常来讲就是说你需要占用八个空地的话，房子你只要起四个马厩的卡组都可以使用它。然后很早去犁到六块田的卡组也可以使用它。同时一些需要围两次的卡组也可以使用它。
A041,蔬果刨刀,Vegetable Slicer,T2,,C,キッチンスライサー,只要能启动一次就有足够的性能。,"Each time you upgrade a Fireplace to a Cooking Hearth, you immediately get 2 wood and 1 vegetable (not retroactively).",,,比较弱的一动卡。算是一个很弱的种子卡。看你需要一个菜的时候你可以抓他。但是有时候你如果过早的抓它，你后面不需要火炉就很尴尬。就是天时地利人和的情况下还是比较强的，通常情况下不是那么强大。这张卡基本基本没见有人能用出来过。唯一的操作可能就是配合畜牧教师加法救工人。太苛刻了，一般没啥用。
A042,湖心小筑,Forest Lake Hut,T3,,,森の湖畔荘,单体效果也不差，但如果可以的话，最好结合捕鱼连招来运用。,"Each time you use the ""Fishing""/""Forest"" accumulation space, you also get 1 wood/food.",,,
A043,农场粪肥,Farmyard Manure,T3,,F,堆肥,如果拿到成吉思汗或羊饭，就更容易从首次增筑开始发动。即使一次建多座也只会启动1次。通过材木的名手或临时劳动者等效果，在自己回合以外建厩舍也不会发动效果。,"Each time you build 1 or more stables in one turn, you place 1 food on each of the next 3 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,这张卡基本基本没见有人能用出来过，唯一的操作可能就是配合畜牧教师加马厩工人吧，太苛刻了，一般没啥用
A045,防火池塘,Fire Protection Pond,T3,,,防火用貯水池,虽然有时间差，但如果打算尽早改建的话，是还不错的饭补。,"Once you no longer live in a wooden house, place 1 food on each of the next 6 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
A046,剃毛刀,Claw Knife,T4,,,蹄ナイフ,"""正好""牧场1是瓶颈。尽早拉栅栏，只要能干哪怕1次活就足够。有小牧场，在用炉灶烹饪区吃饭推进的场面里很优秀。","Each time you use the ""Sheep Market"" accumulation space, place 1 food on each of the next 2 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
A047,网格棚架,Trellises,T4,,,格子垣,想在第8~9回合左右拉栅栏并触发。有小牧场的话就能轻松1木4饭,"Immediately place 1 food on each of the next round spaces, up to the number of fences you have built. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
A048,刨工台,Shaving Horse,T0,,A,削り馬,因为每次获得木材时都可以启动效果，所以像树木园丁或伐木工那样，先获得木材1然后再额外获得木材的情况下，只要满足条件就能启动2次。如果因为擅自转换造成的影响而觉得木不够，也可以先拉一道栅栏把手头的木减少一下。,"Each time after you obtain at least 1 wood, if you then have 5 or more wood in your supply, you can exchange 1 wood for 3 food. With 7 or more wood, you must do so.",,,价值大概是在一个A级里面比较弱的位置。它的价值完完全全的取决于就是你前期究竟要花多少饭。因为他的这个兑换效率放在后期来讲是不算很高的，一个木头兑换三口饭，这个效率在后期超额的有限。他主要的收益就是在前期，你究竟能够把多少根木头兑换成饭。因为在前期木头基本上相当于一半，你前期每使用一次刨工台你就相当于净赚了两饭收益。刨工台在前期是指在前三季，在前三季刨工台如果能够提供到六饭收益的话，他就是一个强B卡。如果能提供到八饭收益的话，他就是一个强A卡。如果能提供到12饭以上收益的话，那他有S卡的水平。但是12饭的收益基本上就意味着你是有多个木头的消食物的消耗卡，比如箩筐加树农这种比较少见的情况。通常情况下把它是一个B卡的水平，取一个平均放在A卡里面。
A049,芦苇苗区,Nest Site,T2,,,営巣地,场上芦苇补助越多，去拿芦苇的玩家就越少，所以越容易发挥。反过来，如果有玩家通过芦苇原combo去芦苇1的话，会大幅弱体化，需要注意。,"Each time 1 reed is placed on a non-empty ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space during the preparation phase, you get 1 food.",,,
A051,流网渔船,Drift-Net Boat,T3,,,流し網船,作为补充食物的手段还不错，但成本里的芦苇有点偏重。要注意别把芦苇消耗掉，免得扩建被拖慢。,"Each time you use the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, you get an additional 2 food.",,,
A052,飞斧,Throwing Axe,T2,,,手投げ斧,作为中后期的饭补助很优秀。能产出大约10饭。,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space while there is at least 1 wild boar on the ""Pig Market"" accumulation space, you also get 2 food.",,,
A054,贷款,Credit,T2,,,信用貸し,在饭基础盘搭建完善之前用来过渡的,"When you play this card, you immediately get 5 food. At the end of each round that does not end with a harvest, you must pay 1 food, or else take a begging marker.",,,
A057,挤奶棚,Milking Parlor,T3,,,搾乳施設,因为即使是1羊也有2饭的效果，所以如果是灶台玩法，就能不费劲地发挥效果。,"When you play this card, if you have at least 1/3/4 sheep, you immediately get 2/3/4 food. The same applies if you have at least 1/2/3 cattle.",,,
A058,芦笋刀,Asparagus Knife,T3,,E,アスパラガスナイフ,如果有很多蔬菜就是很优秀的效果。这个效果用得太多，以至于播种时蔬菜没了，那就本末倒置了。,"In the returning home phase of rounds 8, 10, and 12, you can take 1 vegetable from exactly 1 vegetable field. You can immediately exchange it for 3 food and 1 bonus point.",,,在有配合的情况下是一动。这也就是他全部的价值了，不是很高。他最多最多是在一个非常苛刻的条件下给你三个上限分。所以撑死两动，通常是不到2动的。还需要既有菜又要多次播种。
A059,马铃薯起垄机,Potato Ridger,T3,,,じゃがいも畝立て機,虽然需要播种和蔬菜补助，但1蔬菜=6饭的转换效率很优秀。,"Each time after you harvest 1+ vegetables, if you then have 3+ vegetables in your supply, you can turn exactly 1 vegetable into 6 food. With 4+ vegetables, you must do so.",,,
A060,东方火炉,Oriental Fireplace,T3,,B,東洋かまど,相当优秀的转换效率。为了吃野猪而再次去拿镰刀调是效率很差的，所以绝对不要这么做。,"At any time: Vegetable → 4 Food; Sheep → 3 Food; Cattle → 5 Food ""Bake Bread"" action: Grain → 2 Food",,,强度：算是一张核心的食物卡。你有它之后，你可以用羊获得大量的食物。你抓了它之后，你后面就可以考虑这些食物的用途了。前期围绕着它，你可以获得除了羊之外，包括菜和牛也有一些配合所在。你可以用它在全局收益到十个食物以上。然后只不过他需要的配合就是他和刨工台相比，他第一个是来的比刨工台慢，没办法配合特别早期的食物消耗。它需要配合第二季，他在第二季开始才有食物可供消耗。但是你在第二季以后，它可以提供通常可以提供十个以上的食物。所以他是算是一张B级的核心卡，能够提供大量食物的核心卡。
A061,簸谷机,Winnowing Fan,T3,,,箕,,"After the field phase of each harvest, you can use a baking improvement but only to turn exactly 1 grain into food. (This is not considered a ""Bake Bread"" action.)",,,
A062,啤酒桶,Beer Keg,T1,,,樽詰ビール,小麦越多越好，但即使只是作为把1小麦变成3饭的饭补助，也还算不错。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, you can use this card to exchange 1/2/3 grain for 0/1/2 bonus points and exactly 3 food.",,,
A064,大麦磨台,Barley Mill,T4,,F,大麦製粉機,成本太重了。只出食物。奖励点也只有1点，搞不懂到底想干什么。,"In the field phase of each harvest, you get 1 food for each grain field that you harvest.",,,低配垄作。他的麦子转化效率太低了，约等于每个麦子多给一口饭。这个效率实际上是在麦子转化卡里算是非常低的。可能只有那一张能把麦子当建筑资源用的不太强的卡能跟这张卡组配合。正常麦子本身就已经转换成饭了，意义不大。
A065,捆装种子,Seed Pellets,T2,,D,ペレット種子,从序盘开始就做3块田的话，是很优秀的小麦补助。,"Each time before you take an unconditional ""Sow"" action, you get 1 grain.",,,小于一动。它要求太苛刻了，特别要求特别苛刻。大部分情况下也就给一个麦子，给两个麦子的情况下他才算是一张合格的卡。给一个麦子的话挺一般的。就是没有什么能抓的时候勉强能一抓。
A066,喂食盘,Feeding Dish,T3,,,餌皿,如果是灶台厨房玩法就能发挥作用。赶牲畜者因为是先通过效果获得家畜之后再进入累积的处理，所以即使是在一只也没养的状态下进入也能启动效果。,"Each time you use an animal accumulation space while already having an animal of that type, you get 1 grain.",,,
A068,芦笋礼物,Asparagus Gift,T2,,,アスパラガスの贈り物,是否启动一次的效果。中盘以后即使顺其自然地打也比较容易触发。,"Each time you build a number of fences equal to or greater than the current round, you immediately get 1 vegetable.",,,
A070,起重机,Lifting Machine,T4,,F,堀り取り機,如果有优秀的播种辅助，就能通过立刻把收获的蔬菜重新种下去来增加，所以效果还算不错，但基本上看起来很少有能发挥作用的场合。,"At the end of each round that does not end with a harvest, you can move 1 vegetable from one of your fields to your supply. (This is not considered a field phase.)",,,基本没有用过，不知道它有什么用，非常奇怪。因为它一次只能收一块地，相当于每一季只能多收一块，这实在是太少了。所以只有在非常奇怪的情况下才可以用它。一般情况下是没啥使用空间的，被芦笋刀完爆。
A072,钙肥,Calcium Fertilizers,T3,,,石灰肥料,可以和储藏房间打出联动组合。,"Each time you use a ""Quarry"" accumulation space, add 1 additional good of the respective type to each of your planted fields growing a single type of crop.",,,
A073,农业肥料,Agricultural Fertilizers,T3,,E,農業用肥料,用各种锄头耕2块以上的田地也无法发挥效果。可以通过建厩、围栏或增筑来发动效果，但和播种效果不契合，所以不能说是优秀的卡牌。要是能和像树篱管理员那样能多次抽到围栏的卡牌搭配的话，或许还有可能性……,"Each time after you turn at least 2 unused spaces into used spaces in one action, you get an additional ""Sow"" action.",,,这张这张卡就是两马厩或者俩房子送你一次播种，这张卡的话中规中矩吧，因为毕竟播种这个东西，它的特点是很少需要连续去播种。大部分情况下，这个两次播种的间隔都是非常长的。这张卡通常就是认为有配合的情况下提供了资本，算是D和E中间吧，就是如果你能抓得起他那他算是一张能打的卡
A074,树洞圈舍,Stable Tree,T1,,C,厩の木,一次建造多个也只启动1次。通过“材木の名手”或“臨時労働者”等效果在自己回合以外建造时，效果也不会发动。,"Each time you build 1 or more stables on your turn, place 1 wood on each of the next 3 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the wood.",,,这是一张在核心和这个有核心强度，也有单卡强度的一张卡。这张卡单卡强度一般认为是两根木头，算是一个可以接受的强度。同时或许还有卡马厩的一些操作。赌到配合的话，价值有四动。但是另一个角度呢就是这张卡它的强度高低非常依赖于你上家的玩法。就是说你上家如果是一个不喜欢扣卡的玩家的话，那他的强度还可以。如果你上家非常喜欢扣卡的话，那在234抓里看到的，他强度可以说几乎相当于零。竞技场环境下，这张卡在234抓的强度很少可以看得见。但是它本身的强度又不值得一抓。所以说综合来讲就很只有在很少的情况下你去抓其他卡才能够烂到让你去手抓一张这个卡。所以综合来讲的话，它的强度只能在C里面偏弱的强度，这是它的平均强度。
A076,玉米穗轴,Cob,T3,,,わら粘土,先做好小麦田，用来改建or增建or制陶吧,"At the start of each work phase, if you have at least 1 clay in your supply, you can exchange exactly 1 grain for 2 clay and 1 food.",,,
A077,砖头背篓,Hod,T2,,,背負いかご,尤其在终盘能获得大量砖。若像制陶场或做土器之类，直到终盘仍有砖的用途的话，就特别优秀。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 clay. Each time any player (including you) uses the ""Pig Market"" accumulation space, you immediately get 2 clay.",,,
A079,农用锄头,Garden Hoe,T3,,,園芸用くわ,条件比较苛刻，但如果能顺利发动，效果还算不错。即使一次撒下多个，能拿到的也还是每次1个,"Each time you take an unconditional ""Sow"" action planting vegetables in at least 1 field, you get 1 clay and 1 stone.",,,
A081,临时仓库,Interim Storage,T3,,,一時保管庫,2饭有点重。尽量不从盘面拿木，想和砖或芦原相关的卡组合作为一套来运用。,"Each time you use a clay/reed/stone accumulation space, place 1 wood/clay/reed on this card. At the start of rounds 7, 11, and 14, move all the goods on this card to your supply.",,,
A082,工作证,Work Certificate,T0,,,労働証明書,能拿到还算不少的砖、木等。实际上等于削减其他玩家的资源。如果有像“找蘑菇”之类把材料放回去的卡，或小动作强化，盘面上的资源更容易留下来，发动机会也更容易增加。,"Each time after you use an action space, you can take 1 building resource from a building resource accumulation space with at least 4 building resources on it.",,,
A084,青贮饲料,Silage,T3,,F,穀物飼料,因为只能增加已经能够繁殖的家畜，所以并不算太强力。和织布机或牛王子等需要大量特定家畜的卡牌相性很好。,"In each returning home phase after which there is no harvest, you can pay exactly 1 grain—even from a field-to breed exactly one type of animal.",,,这张卡一个麦子换一个动物根本赚，一个麦子比正常来讲比一个动物大，所以这张卡也不是太需要考虑的卡
A085,女管家,Homekeeper,T1,,,家政婦,不增建就利用的话，田地和栅栏的配置会受限制，操作起来有点不方便。从初始配置把房子建成L字形，用来给第4人以后增员时使用比较稳妥。能同时进行改建和修栅栏的成功者非常契合。,Exactly one clay or stone room in your house can hold an additional person if the room is adjacent to both a field and a pasture.,"效果：如果你住在砖屋或石屋，且你的一个房间与田和圈地相邻，那么你多一个居住空间
强度：顶级扩卡，早翻+早围+手扣1田就相当于扩了，2屋流神卡。横向对比常规扩屋，省下了5w+2r+1c+1s，只少了3 分，相当于省下了8+分数。
难度：3/5
用法：如果没有神父、翻修公司、尊贵之人等2砖屋专属卡，推荐还是先扩一间木头再翻修打女管家，提高自己的人口上限。如果有上述2砖屋卡，可以直接在第一二回合的2动犁田堵死房屋，第一季专心早翻+在房屋右侧早围。如果扩一间木头的话，推荐在第二列第三行扩屋，在第二列第二行犁田，然后照常右侧早围。然后中期扣羊、猪搭配：顶级配合尊贵之人，2屋+早围",,
A089,马厩规划师,Stable Planner,T2,,,厩設計士,单体也有3点+确保繁殖空间的话还算不错,"Add 3, 6, and 9 to the current round. You can place 1 stable on each corresponding round space. A the start of these rounds (not earlier), you can build the stable at no cost.","效果：往之后的3,6,9回合各摆1个马厩，回合开始建造它
强度：3 马厩卡，保底3 分上限，或者可以说6w上限。并且有饲养空间和繁殖空间的额外收益。请注意，这并不是说明它严格比养猪大户强，因为他要前五回合打出，这造成了额外成本。
难度：2/5
用法：前五回合没有过多前期卡可以充当前期卡打出，不影响扩生时打就好搭配：马厩流卡牌",,
A091,轮耕农,Shifting Cultivator,T3,,,焼畑農家,只要有强力的饭基盘，就无可挑剔地优秀,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you can also play 3 food to plow 1 field.","效果：每当你使用木头积累行动格时，可以花3f 犁1田
强度：大部分情况下略弱于森林犁，但是3f换1田本身赚0.5 分左右，触发四五次还是可以回本2-3 分的，不错的。如果有强力食物手段，这张卡的收益最大可以达到6 田2+2+1.5+1.5+1.5+0.5分，也就是9 分。
难度：2/5
用法：中期食物不紧缺又需要播种时就可以开始犁田了，尤其是四五季一定要多犁，第六季食物富裕可以补犁。搭配：炉火手推车，炉火陶瓷，蒸汽机手推车，蒸汽机陶瓷，湖心小筑，飞斧，采菇，篮子，木护，翻修费，森林巨石等踩木头的食物手段。或者是强力食物手段比如男仆。马厩清洁工等利用第六季木头的手段。",,
A093,木床制造工,Bed Maker,T2,,,ベッド造り,如果是前期建造小麦田的路线，效果还算不错。增建了2间以上的情况下也只能增加1个人口。,"Each time you add rooms to your house, you can also pay 1 wood and 1 grain to immediately get a ""Family Growth with Room Only"" action.",,,
A094,偷懒播种工,Lazy Sowman,T2,,,怠惰な種まき,进入“畑种”行动后进行“播种取消”→再次执行“畑种”，这样就能在1回合内一口气把田地按家族人数全部耕好。,"Each time you decline an unconditional ""Sow"" action on your turn, you can immediately place another person on an action space of your choice (even if it is occupied).","效果：每当你在你的轮次放弃一个无限制的播种，你可以立即放置你的另一个家庭成员到任意格子（包括已被占据的非聚会场所格子）
强度：这张卡没有配合的话，朴素上是一张不卡田的卡，并且赠送一定农业价值，算是略弱于无配合的耕帮。
难度：3/5
用法：最朴素的用法有前期播烤生娃，R12播烤超生，R13 犁播超生，R14 犁播*n 次。如果犁播被占了，还可以播烤跳犁播。注意第三四季要真实地播一次，第六季再播，发挥农业优势。搭配：赠送无条件的播种的卡如年幼农夫，强化或容易触发播烤的卡如新手学徒、吟游诗人，强化或容易触发犁播的卡如轮式犁、同桌。搭配种子卡一定可以第六季种下去，因此可以走农业卡。不搭：注意，不在自己轮次播种的卡如播种大师无法搭配偷懒播种工，农孩、二婚配偶这些本来就可以踩已被占据格子的卡也和偷懒播种功能重叠。田卡也功能重叠。",,
A095,钓鱼人,Angler,T3,,,釣り師,单体的话火力不足，但渔有很多连招,"Each time after you use the ""Fishing"" Accumulation space while there are at most 2 food on that space, you get a ""Major or Minor Improvement"" action.","效果：如果你踩钓鱼行动格并拿到不超过2f，你获得一次“打主发或次发”行动
强度：没配合一般不考虑这张卡，有钓鱼配合的话有T2以上的强度。第一、二季的次发（尤其是R2-4的次发）用优雅的方式而不是抢先打出是很好的。
难度：3/5
用法：一般前两回合打出，R2和R4 末动要踩一次钓鱼，后续的钓鱼不用每次偶数回合踩，但是早踩打出关键次发是有利的。中后期有石头手段了去钓鱼偷主发。搭配：配合主发行动的卡如瓦匠，小商贩，钓鱼套卡牌，注意流网渔船虽然不搭：被敌方的渔网完克
变体：钓鱼人啤酒池，R1职业，R2职业钓鱼打啤酒",,
A096,任务型工匠,Task Artisan,T1,,,受注生産職人,3木3小进分。,"When you play this card and each time a stone accumulation space appears on a round space in the preparation phase, you get 1 wood and a ""Minor Improvement"" action.","效果：打出此卡和每次石头行动格翻开时，你获得1w和一个次要发展卡行动
强度：T1中的顶级卡，给了你两张前期次要发展卡的机会，两个前期w，和一个中后期的次要发展机会和中后期w。前期每张次要发展机会都大概价值2-3 分，也就是前两季可以兑现8收益，第四季再拿到1收益，总共轻易9 收益的卡。
难度：3/5
用法：要估算石头翻开的时间和你要打的卡，以及做出抢先、生娃的规划、多拿两张前期次发，少拿一张前期职业，不要冲突，最好用任务工打出关键卡，达到收益最大化。大部分情况下在第一季打出，偶尔可以在R5 或第三季打出。搭配：蓝图、手工艺推广等强化次发的卡，污水坑、餐具室等前期卡，提煤筐、心形石等依赖石头翻出后顺便打出的卡
变体：任务工心形石，第一季专心攒房本+任务工，R5 翻石就打心形石，R5 翻生就生。任务工书柜，打出时立即获得1菜。任务工鸟巢，善用石头的时间打出鸟巢。EthanHuang: 补充，如果一号位任务工书柜，可以3w开而不是免费职业开，因为宁丢1饭，不丢1菜",,
A097,新手学徒,Freshman,T0,,,新入生,好也罢坏也罢，全看烤面包补助的情况。序盘要是做小麦田的话也不是不能用，但很少会多次进入“谷物活用”，所以没有烤面包补助就很难运用。和“烘焙点心教室”很契合。,"Each time you get a ""Bake Bread"" action, instead of taking the action, you can play an occupation without paying an occupation cost.","效果：每当你获得烤面包行动时（你不需要有烤面包的工具或材料），你可以放弃这个烤面包行动，改为免费打出一个职业。每个轮次，每个丰收节段限一次。
强度：这张卡是用来赌配合的，主要是赌面包套组件，比如说烘焙，面包铲，吟游诗人等。一旦有这种面包套组件，两张卡的效果就超过乞丐学徒3 分+更早打出职业，这张卡就有了强",,
A099,牧场帮手,Fellow Grazer,T2,,,放牧人,木效率稍微差一点，但用3格牧场×2（13根）可以得到4分。用6格15根栅栏也能做出3格牧场，所以可以活用。,"During scoring, you get 2 bonus points of reach pasture you have covering at least 3 farmyard spaces.","效果：你的每个不小于3 格的圈地计2分
强度：条件不苛刻的晚期打的超短反馈4 分上限卡，很优秀
难度：2/5
用法：基本上两种用法，14 木围8 面积两个 4格，或者13 木围6 面积两个3 格。牧场帮手对于8 面积的加强尤为厉害，因为6 面积的围法其实亏了1w，是亏了接近1分的，因此如果你田和房子比较多，可以降低牧场帮手的抓位。搭配：8 围2田流等，如牧羊杖",,
A100,博物馆馆长,Curator,T3,,,後見人,由于是累积空间，所以羊、渔等也属于对象。与喜欢动物等增加进入家畜格机会的卡牌相性很好。和木头或砖的累积强化搭配也不坏。,"In the returning home phase of each round, if you return at least 3 people from accumulation spaces, you can buy 1 bonus point for 1 food.","效果：每个回家阶段，如果你有不少于3 个家庭成员从积累行动格回来，你可以用1食物换取1分
强度：考虑中后期1食物的模型是0.5 分左右，这张卡可以刷到至多6 次，上限是6f 换6上限分水平，其实这个强度可以到T2。但是实战中，很多情况你无法拿三个累计行动，你需要快速生到4 娃才可能每回合做到，因此触发4次就不错了，大概2分超额收益，规划好回本的一张职业。
难度：4/5
用法：这张卡由于没上线bga，所以用法很难说，体感有两种流派。第一种是三屋流，先R6左右生到一个，R7-11五回合中触发3-4 次，拿木头拿砖拿动物拿食物。其中1-2回合可以围栅栏、田、翻修、打卡这种。然后如果第五季超生一次，五六季有希望再触发1-2次，这就是勉强回本的上限分。另一种用法是4-5 屋流，一般到R11能生满就不错，然后 R11-14触发四次回本。搭配：强力食物手段如鱼叉，快速生娃手段如针线编制工，累积行动也能干活的手段如猪围、木护等",,
A101,厨具装配工,Cookery Outfitter,T3,,,調理器具商,达到2点以上的情况相当罕见。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each cooking improvement you have.","效果：每个带锅标志的卡计1分（不包括砖烤，石烤）
强度：也就是大概包括2个火炉，2个壁炉，东方火炉，土制火炉，女巫舞池，期望收益大概就是1分，但是可以第六季打是优点
难度：3/5
用法：基本上扣首锅，中期后期再扣一两个，终局打出，职业套可以当个1分白板用搭配：抢锅套如砌砖工，窑洞看守，烤炉区，烧炭工，后期给砖卡如环保砖",,
A103,港口商贩,Portmonger,T3,,,港の商人,无论何时去都有还不错的效果。根据展开和其他手牌来调整进入打捞的时机吧。,"Each time you take 1/2/3+ food from a food accumulation space, you also get 1 vegetable/grain/reed.","效果：每当你从食物积累行动格拿取1/2/3+f时，你获得1菜/麦/r
强度：单卡负收益，单卡最多拿8r，还需要手动拿每个3f，很亏，赌配合
难度：2/5
用法：有强势钓鱼卖艺组合或早菜需求才用。常见的是鱼叉或者魅惑。如果是鱼叉，就前中期打出后，中期拿2-3 次2鱼，拿到2-3 麦，后期钓1鱼，拿到2-5菜，播种只播种麦子，麦菜满分。如果是魅惑，第一季钓一次1麦，一次1菜，拿一次rsf 和一次羊，剩余的三动可以考虑2田播种麦菜，循环利用，然后r5 魅出来。搭配：强势钓鱼卖艺组合，如鱼叉、啤酒池、有临工套的少年艺术家，相当于送了满分麦菜；魅惑者等需要前期麦菜的组合",,
A104,木头收割工,Wood Harvester,T2,,,木材収穫者,注意：不是按每个回合，而是在收获阶段之前发动。几乎没有还剩3木的情况，2木每次都被拿走也并不少见。森林犁一出就会发光。,"In the field phase of each harvest, you get 1 wood/1 food for each wood accumulation space with exactly 2 wood/at least 3 wood.","效果：每季结束时，每个恰好2w的木头累积行动格令你从公共区获得1w，每个3+w的木头累积行动格令你从公共区获得1f
强度：抓人的随机应变卡，如果第一季可以拿到至少1w1f 就值得打出，期望收益略高于伐木工，有配合的话收益可以达到线人。我之前有一局森林犁木割，可以达到10w5f 收益，超过树农线人。
难度：3/5
用法：控木头累积格子，比如说丰收前一回合要把森林树林都扣了，这样子丰收回合可以留3w，2w。然后丰收前二或第三回合把林地扣了，丰收可以留2w或3w，掌握节奏。但是注意扣这些东西的时候不要影响自己的节奏，不然得不偿失。搭配：任何人的森林犁、木巡、林业研究、木护、篮子等留木头尤其是留2w的卡不搭：任何人的木推、采菇等多踩木头卡，任何人的森林科学家这种触发条件矛盾的卡",,
A105,手推车工,Barrow Pusher,T2,,,猫車押し,虽然取决于盘面，但如果能耕4张牌，按计算就已经回本了。和效果类似的耕作者相比，砖块因为在终盘的用途有限，所以会稍微逊色一些。,"For each new field tile you get, you also get 1 clay and 1 food.","效果：每当你犁一田，你获得1c+1f
强度：中后期的c急速贬值，大部分情况下基本认为一个c的价值在0.2-0.7 之间。按照0.5计算的话，这张卡就算5 田也只能给你带来5收益，但是如果只有2田就只有2收益了，算上打卡花的食物得不偿失。是上限可以碰到T1边，但是下限只有不足2分收益的方差较大的卡。
难度：2/5
用法：轮抽时如果有田手段可以当做T1卡拿，如果没有田手段可以当做T3 卡拿，总归是三四季犁田前打出或者看情况不打出搭配：犁田卡，早农砖扩流，用砖手段如泥潭",,
A106,撒泥工,Slurry Spreader,T4,,,液肥散布人,发动机会并不是那么多，能配合的卡也比较少。如果有大镰使或挖掘铲子的话，效果还算不错。,"In the field phase of each harvest, each time you take the last grain/vegetable from a field, you also get 2 food/1 food.",,,
A107,捕猎者,Catcher,T4,,,待ち構え,发动条件很难，发动了也不强。,"Each time you place your 1st/2nd/3rd person in a round on a building resource accumulation space with exactly 5/4/3 building resources, you get 1 food.",,,
A109,小商贩,Small Trader,T4,,,小商人,搭配进步系的连携和套装。即使在改筑大进格也能启动效果。,"Each time you take a ""Major or Minor Improvement"" action to play an improvement from your hand, you also get 3 food.","效果：每当你从“主发或次发行动”中打出一张次发，你获得3f。
强度：怎么说呢，就算是有最强配合讲台桌，你仍然需要至少抢先两次，生两次娃，那么你就已经打了4 张次发了，就算别人传递卡给你传过来一张，你手上最多也就4 张次发可以在主发格子打，有配合封顶12f的卡，相当于上限是T2，平时T4的水准。
难度：3/5
用法：没配合别打搭配：钓鱼人等给你主发行动的卡，讲桌、年幼农夫等加强主发格子、翻主格子的卡不搭：注意家具供应商给你的不是主发行动，而是你可以打出一张主发或次发，由于不带“行动”二字，因此无法触发",,
A113,异教导师,Heresy Teacher,T3,,,異端教師,,"Each time you use a ""Lessons"" action space, you get 1 vegetable in each of your fields with at least 3 grain and no vegetable. Place the vegetable below the grain.","效果：每当你使用职业训练行动格时，向每个生长了不少于3 份小麦且没有蔬菜的田上各放一份蔬菜，压放在所有小麦底部
强度：我们一般不认为异教导师打出后可以自我触发，因此，想要触发异教导师的效果，最好的时机是在第六季前打出，然后第六季打一张职业，获得2-3 菜，有3-4 下限分的水平，如果没有别的菜手段可以拿，但是也就比手拿菜要强1-2分。
难度：4/5
用法：上述说的，在首次播种前打出，然后播种后打一个后期职业搭配：一张合格的五六季职业，前中期麦子卡不搭：菜卡",,
A115,首席林务官,Chief Forester,T4,,,森林官,容易提高种点。有田地辅助或烤面包辅助的话更容易发挥作用。,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you also get a ""Sow"" action for exactly 1 field.","效果：每当你使用木头积累行动格，可以往最多1田播种。
强度：注意这个是有限制的播种，因此不能触发海藻肥等要求“无限制播种”的卡，所谓无限制播种就是不限制播种多少田，不限制种子种类，完全等同于“播烤”格的播种。这张卡要求你在拿木头准备围的时候，赚取播种的收益，基本相当于第二三四季播种+第五季的播一点点，并且加强了第六季的格子。但是其实你打这张卡的功夫，就可以踩一次播烤，往往是更赚的，因此单卡无价值。
难度：3/5
用法：没配合，尤其是早期农业卡，就不要打。搭配：除草铲、麦田里的床等需求播种少量田的卡牌，麦子收割工加强播种效率的卡牌",,
A117,运木工,Wood Carrier,T1,,,木材調達人,终盘的栅栏材料。与按订单生产的工匠和年轻农夫相性很好。选取时，降低传给邻家的进步优先度吧。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood fore each improvement in front of you.","效果：你面前每有一张发展卡，你立即获得1w
强度：极其恐怖的卡，认为是强T1到接近弱T0的水平。一般在第五季围前打出，可以轻松拿到 6-10w，条件和收益都接近吹牛大王的 6-9分，但是这个 6-9 分是下限分，而不像吹牛的上限分，因此弱一级",,
A118,树农,Treegardener,T1,,,樹木庭師,每次收获都有1木也算不错。有足够的食料的话，即使从中盘开始打出也无可挑剔地强。若有家具制作，最后一次收获时的木也能利用起来。,"In the field phase of each harvest, you get 1 wood and you can buy up to 2 additional wood for 1 food each.","效果：每个丰收 用0/1/2f买1/2/3w。
强度：保底5w，第一季打出成本是5 分左右，第一季基本不买w，第2-4 季6f 买6w，可以看作3 收益，再加上保底5 收益，第一季打出可以拿到8-10 收益。如果有木工坊收益可以到10以上。
难度：4/5
用法：基本要5 屋，但要解决生娃和养树农的食物矛盾，要有强力食物引擎。不分情况可以二三季打出。搭配：鱼叉猎手等w换f狂亂隐者: 大佬这张的效果是不是有问题？在每个收获的收割阶段，你获得1木，且你可以额外再支付最多2份食物购买相同数量的木。EthanHuang: 回复 狂亂隐者 :就是0/1/2f买1/2/3w，bga 应该是简化了购买流程",,
A121,砖头冲压工,Clay Puncher,T3,,,レンガの刻印うち,打出时可以获得2砖。如果有明确的砖用法，这个效果不算差。与釣鐘铸造师很契合。,"When you play this card and each time after you use a ""Lessons"" action space or the ""Clay Pit"" accumulation space, you get 1 clay.","效果：你打出这张卡、每次使用职业格、每次使用1c累积行动格时，你获得1c
强度：在bga 上不知道是不是bug，在职业格打出这张卡时满足了两个触发条件，直接给2c，这让他的收益极其显著，在首羊局或者首主局，这张卡的打出价值就接近一个标准动4分，再考虑后续收益轻松到6+分。如果不是首羊首炉的R1打出，其余情况基本只有职业套或缺砖流派可以用。
难度：3/5
用法：首羊或者首主局R1打出，其余情况职业套或缺砖流派使用，整体上和家具匠差不多",,
A122,平锅烘焙师,Pan Baker,T4,,,鍋パン作り,如果能去两次，就是4砖2木的量。既然在为了利用谷物而进去两次的时候点上，很多情况下应该已经拿到窑了，所以经常会为砖的用途而烦恼。,"Each time you use the ""Grain Utilization"" action space, you also get 2 clay and 1 wood.","效果：每当你使用播烤，你获得2c1w
强度：一局你就算播烤两次（其实已经很亏了），收益也才4c2w，不回本
难度：2/5
用法：除非被卡砖，翻修不了，或者职业套，否则不要用搭配：新手学徒这种加强播烤格子的大哥，陶瓷器皿这种需要播或者需要烤，又需要砖的卡，也很适合",,
A124,石头打磨工,Knapper,T3,,,石材研磨師,效果不稳定，但如果需要大量石头的话可以作为选项。因为在行动前能拿到石头，所以即使差1石的场面也能进入改筑大进。,"Each time before you use an action space card on round spaces 5 to 7, you get 1 stone.","效果：每当你使用第5-7 回合的行动格前，你获得1s
强度：第5 回合左右打出，可以得到3 生 2翻1石，一共最多5-6s收益，对于5 屋翻石流，是一张显著比木匠强的卡，超额收益在2分左右，但是和木匠同样都是限制在5 屋才能使用，前期职业普遍更强，且中后期石头贬值，要有横截木等石头利用手段，或凑职业套，才考虑打出这种2分超额收益的前期职业。
难度：3/5
用法：第五回合如果没有别的超额收益的职业，且看到5 生局可以再打，并且你要保证你扩到5 屋能有翻、有田、有围、有饭不崩盘，那这张卡的收益你才可以吃干抹净。中后期要有横截木、士兵、手工艺推广等石头利用手段，多扣主发。搭配：加强生次、翻主、西矿场的卡，比如锱铢必较。最好要用围的手段，你扩3 翻2，又不依赖翻围，是容易丢围的，田园篱笆可以保护这一点。",,
A126,工匠大师,Master Workman,T3,,,熟練職人,喜欢动物，一边多次去找羊，一边勤快地拉栅栏拿到炉灶，这样的展开感觉最能发光。,"Each time before you use an action space card on round spaces 1/2/3/4, you get 1 wood/clay/reed/stone.","效果：每当你使用第1/2/3/4 回合的行动格之前，你先获得1w/c/r/s
强度：单卡负收益，全局一般拿不到5 资源，伐木不如的水平
难度：2/5
用法：没配合不用，纯粹赌配合的卡，职业套可以中后期垫职业，有配合要前期出搭配：讲台桌、年幼农夫两员大将都可以带工匠大师这个小弟，还有播烤流大将新手学徒，羊市大将针线编制工，栅栏大将篱笆护理员、家畜守护者等。",,
A127,寄宿者,Lodger,T3,,,間借り人,如果在第1回合不怎么准备扩建，而是去建小麦田或摆出职业的话，就更容易发挥效果。最好是和能在中盘以后一下子扩建好几间房的“レンガの柱”或“木の家増築士”等组合一起运用。,"This card provides room for one person, but only until the returning home phase of round 9. If, by then, there is no room elsewhere for that person, remove it from play.","效果：这张卡可以提供一个家庭成员的居住空间，如果你在R9 回家阶段仍然未给这张卡上的家庭成员提供居住空间，则将之永久移除游戏（也就是你后续也不能生到5 人口）
强度：这张卡的强度极其依赖你第一个娃生在第几回合，如果R9 生娃， 则无价值。每早生一回合，相当于你赚了一回合的晚扩房子，你赚了建筑材料的贬值的差价。因为前期建筑材料贵，后期建筑材料便宜，晚扩的收益还在于一次扩多间屋子，如R8 扩2-3 间。5 生局保底可以抢1生+省下一动扩屋，回本的水平。7 生局单卡不回本。
难度：4/5
用法：如果你确认你本来就想晚扩屋，那么这张卡就值得抓。比如说你第一季需要做农巡或污水坑的早农业，腌制工、收集者等的早畜牧业，或者你有木扩、支柱等晚扩省建材的卡，都值得你在R5 等时机抢先再打出这张卡，抢到一生。需要注意的是，小心R8-9的扩屋格子被别人恶意卡住。搭配：农巡、小户农、污水坑、木扩、支柱、黏土小屋建筑者等晚扩卡，羊生、麦床、奶妈等前期生娃卡不搭：情圣等超生卡，木贸、佃农、休闲木匠、流浪汉等一间间扩屋卡。",,
A128,河岸建造工,Riparian Builder,T4,,,岸辺の建築士,发动时机不稳定，而且基本上两回合里也只能发动一次甚至更少。就算用于砖块增筑连招，也很痛的是一次只能盖1栋。,"Each time another player uses the ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you can build a room: if you build a clay/stone room, you get a discount of 1 clay/2 stone.","效果：每当其他人使用芦苇池行动格后，你可以建造恰好一间房子，如果这个房子是砖/石屋，你减免1c/2s花费。
强度：毫无强度的一张卡，因为你要扩建屋子，需要芦苇，但是你却不能自己去除了R2的2r格子，这要求你中后期多踩rsf 才行，还要看别人的脸色，往往会因为别人都不踩芦苇池而最后一个生娃。
难度：5/5
用法：控制住rsf 格子，凑齐自己扩建资源的同时，逼着别人踩芦苇格子，然后你要在R4 前攒够扩屋资源，不然毫无强度，这要求了你的前期除了河岸建造工最好是家庭版，然后R3 打河岸建造。搭配：砌墙工、温馨家庭等要求一张张生的卡，别人家的啤酒池、河岸林务官等加强芦苇池的卡
变体：切石工、河岸建造、木匠、茅草可以达到0 费用扩建石屋",,
A129,流浪汉,Swagman,T3,,,放浪者,在增筑很忙的局面下很难把握打出的时机，但即使增筑很拥挤也能走“小麦→增筑”，这一点很优秀。能启动2次就足够了。,"Immediately after each time you use the ""Farm Expansion"" or ""Grain Seeds"" action space, you can use the respective other space with the same person (even if it is occupied).","效果：每当你使用小麦种子或农场扩建之一的行动格，你都可以挪动你的家庭成员到另一个行动格上，哪怕另一个行动格已经被占据。
强度：单卡只能提供2麦，而且要求前中期打出，不合格的下限分卡。这卡是要打配合或者抢生才有收益，如果可以抢到1生，就能回本。有配合的话，可以上调到T2及以上。这卡相对于佃农较弱，有两大原因，一点是麦子套（农巡、私教等）都不务正业，强行打流浪汉节奏容易末生。另一点在于，这张卡虽然相当于佃农可以造多个房子、造马厩，但是没有佃农的翻修用处广泛，因此抓位靠后。
难度：3/5
用法：这里介绍一下两种常见
用法：1.抢生：R4 你没有抢到首扩，可以在R4/5 越早越好打出流浪汉，然后尽早扩一间屋子，之后可以抢先拿到首娃或者次娃，可以拯救末生，如果手上有麦子配合卡，可以在扩第二间前打出即可。2.私教：私教打流浪汉需要多抓一些建材职业，比如说木贸、4w职业、拾柴、温馨、木床等，可以容易地快速打出人口压制，如果职业缺少省建材的则不推荐使用。搭配：木床制造工，快速生5 娃，温馨家庭，私人教师，农巡等麦子套。",,
A130,妈宝,Mummy's Boy,T4,,,ママっ子,在农田位稍微偏重的场合，如果第2手能进农田位，那么最终手也能进农田位算是还不错，但单靠它无论如何能有效发挥效果的场景还是很有限。可以考虑把用森林保护者放下的木拿走，或与日雇组合等搭配使用。,"Once per round, when placing a person after your first two, you can place it on the action space with your 2nd person and use that space again. (Mark the action space).",,,
A131,技校导师,Craft Teacher,T1,,,工芸指南,哪怕只拿到1张也足够回本的效果。如果有能稳定产出石头或进行石头减免的卡，就能疯狂打出职业。要预想别人可能会拿的进步来行动。也需要留意大进格子会不会被占满。,"Each time after you build the major improvement ""Joinery"", ""Pottery"", and ""Basketmaker's Workshop"", you can play up to 2 occupations without paying an occupation cost.","效果：每当你打出一张工坊时，免费打出两张职业
强度：很简单，如果你本来就要打1工坊，这张卡就赚1动1饭，是2.5 收益，如果你本来要打2工坊，这张卡可以到7.5 收益，三工坊就是12.5 收益左右，这种情况下比乞丐学徒。但是其实，工坊本身都亏模，更何况你打出这张牌别人可能更倾向于抢工坊，因此我们分开考虑三个工坊。如果你抢掉砖工坊，付出的代价往往是翻打时没有合适的主发去打，那么可以认为是多花了一动，大概亏2分左右，如果你中期抢掉芦苇工坊，付出的代价大概是少扩一间屋子，也亏了1-2动，大概4 分左右。如果你抢木工坊，一般没人和你抢，只相当于亏掉2个木头，大概1.5分。那么终局来说，你可以用7.5 分换取12.5 分收益，净收益略大于5 分。但是你也因此获得了超过6 分的上限分以及信息差，你可以在轮抽时抓更多工坊牌。
难度：5/5
用法：轮抽时多抓工坊牌，石头牌，获得建材的牌，然后在打工坊时尽量用职业卡做到补齐下限，这样子在终局上下限俱全，容易赢得游戏胜利。在节奏上，我推荐第一季多拿rsf，生完第一个娃后打出这个职业，然后手扣一个工坊并翻打一个工坊抓紧兑现价值，最终在翻石屋时打出木工坊，那么至少需要3+2+2+2的石头手段。搭配：瓦匠、蓝图、切石等工坊手段，五金、处理者、箩筐搬运、树农等建材手段，杂货、制犁等中后期补下限卡EthanHuang: 注意，大陶艺工坊触发不触发技校导师有争议，从字面理解认为不触发",,
A132,酒馆老板,Publican,T4,,,居酒屋の店主,作为1小麦=1点的转换效率算是标准。要是对方把你给的小麦播种了，对方也能拿到相当于1点的分数，所以很难说是一张强力的卡。,"Each time before another player takes an unconditional ""Sow"" action, you can give them 1 grain from your supply to get 1 bonus point.",,,
A134,完美农夫,Full Farmer,T2,,,満載畜産家,6格4牧场的话是12只，4格4牧场的话是8只，两种情况下都能瞄准4分。5格15根栅栏的话也能拿到5分。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood and 1 clay. During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each pasture you have holding the maximum number of animals.","效果：立即获得1w1c，游戏结束时，你每有一个住满动物的圈地，获得1分
强度：1w1c的价值就算贬值到四五季，也接近1.5的下限分，此外这张卡显然有2分好拿的上限分，和3 分很难拿的上限分，总的来说大概是1.5 下限分+3 上限分，与牧场帮手的4 上限分在伯仲之间。
难度：4/5
用法：完美农夫发挥到最优状态的4-5 分，要么你要有收集者一般的海量动物，要么你要有贫农、摇摆步犁等卡利用剩余空地，不然完美农夫的第3、4 分要亏损空地分（因为你的圈地要缩小才能恰好装满动物）。因此完美农夫主要有三种打法：1. 13 木围114的6 格或15 木围116的8 格，然后填满两个面积1的圈地摆烂得2分。2.有足量动物手段时，可以15 木围6 格，怒刷3-4 分，8 羊8 猪8 牛，刷3 分的话只需要8羊5 猪4 牛。3.没有足量动物的话，12木围1111四格或者15 木围11111五格刷4-5 分，只需要8-10 动物，但是要有贫农、担保、摇摆步犁、豪华旅店等办法处理空地。搭配：动物卡、处理空地卡、田卡不搭：马厩卡、扩大圈地容积卡、有机农等要求少养动物的卡",,
A135,畜牧士官,Animal Reeve,T2,,,家畜官,5分的奖励非常大。即使没选到，也要提高对家畜繁殖的优先度，希望在别人打出时也能尽量拿到一点奖励。选秀时如果轮到自己，且看起来没法去抢家畜繁殖的话，自己拿了但不打出来也是一招。,"If there are still 1/3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 1/2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with 2+/3+/4+ animals of each type gets 1/3/5 bonus points.","效果：如果还剩下9/6/3/1个完整回合，你立即获得4/3/2/1w。游戏结束时，三种动物都有至少4/3/2个的玩家获得5/3/1分。
强度：保底一个难做的5 分收益卡，但是可能被其他玩家一起吃分，有配合卡的情况下最大可以做到4w5 分，是4w卡中最强的一个，值得前两抓再拿配合。
难度：4/5
用法：没配合就拿到2牛并且确定自己做出来再五六季打出，有配合就早打拿4w，后期卷牛搭配：牛卡最重要：如木质乳清桶，马厩庭院，召牛，牧草晾晒，收集者，动物猎人，荒野猎手，早产牛等。以及其他动物卡，早围卡等。动物计分卡等。",,
A136,劳务士官,Drudgery Reeve,T3,,,監督官,因为是5分奖励，所以奇袭性能很高。草稿时看到的话想记住的一张卡。要注意，像家具制作所之类在计分计算时会被视为按目标数量消耗相应数量的资材。（需验证）,"If there are still 1/3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 1/2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with 1+/2+/3+ building resources of each type gets 1/3/5 bonus points.","效果：打出时若距离游戏结束还有3/6/9 个完整回合，你立即获得2/3/4 木头，游戏结束时，只要是四种建筑材料都有1+/2+/3+个的玩家就可以获得1/3/5 分
强度：这张卡和畜牧士官不一样，很影响游戏环境，因为畜牧士官拿动物是刚需，但是拿建筑材料不是。因此很多人会考虑要不要去拿建筑资源而不是下限分，并且这张卡会降低工坊的价值，降低主要发展卡，让围更难了，是很卷的一张卡，利好没事干的玩家。保底是一张合格的4w卡，是回本的。
难度：4/5
用法：轮抽时思路一样，如果你在一二抓看到劳务士官，你要考虑拿到更多的高效得资源手段，高效获取下限分的手段，然后腾出空去刷劳务士的上限，这种情况你要前五回合打出来他。如果你在后抓拿到劳务士官，其他人可能有比你更强的高效得资源手段，这种情况你可以观察一下，而中后期再考虑打不打出他，R14打五分也是不错的选择。搭配：这张卡利好所有玩家的五金商店等高效得资源手段不搭：这张卡克制所有玩家的工坊流、主发流、士兵等资源换分卡",,
A137,河边牧羊,Riverine Shepherd,T3,,,川辺の羊飼い,两边都得是在空着的场面效果才发挥得出来，这点很致命。,"Each time you use the ""Sheep Market"" or ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you can also take 1 good from the respective other accumulation space, if possible.",,,
A139,窑洞看守,Hollow Warden,T3,,,窪地のみはり,可以用成吉思汗奇袭，手上有砖2的时候先把炉灶拿了，之后再走炉灶→厨房的路线也行,"When you play this card, you immediately get a ""Major Improvement"" action to build a Fireplace. Each time you use the ""Hollow"" accumulation space, you also get 1 food.","效果：立即获得一次“购买主发——火炉”行动（照常付费），每当你使用窑洞累积行动格时，你额外获得1食物。
强度：这张卡在农场主群被称为飞夺火炉，如果能打出首炉，直接就回本了，然后超额收益3f 左右，特殊情况还有助于强首锅。
难度：3/5
用法：这卡如果你本局预计需要火炉就可以拿，然后观望。如果第1-2回合出羊，但是没有出主发，你就可以飞夺火炉。最强的变化是你R3 拿到4c，R1羊R4 主发，你R3 飞夺掉火炉，超额收益预计可以达到3-4 分左右。就算你没有达到首锅，这张卡也可以在中期用于打3c火炉，但是这种情况一般是职业套才会这么用。搭配：针线编制工等极其需要火炉的卡",,
A140,铲土官,Shovel Bearer,T2,,,ショベル運搬人,虽然相当依赖别人，不过食料产出还算可以。粘土坑・洼地这两者相关的卡意外地不少。,"Each time you use the ""Clay Pit"" or ""Hollow"" accumulation space, you also get a number of food equal to the amount of clay on the respective other accumulation space.","效果：如果你使用其中一个砖头积累格，立即获得另一个砖头积累格上砖头数量的食物
强度：这张卡是砖头流卡牌中的食物卡，可以第一季吃上的那种，前三季吃得很饱，但是后继无力的前期食物卡。
难度：3/5
用法：要算好第一季需要多少砖，第一季至少要踩两次砖再打，大部分情况可以在前两回合打出，第三回合可以踩3c拿4f的话，第四回合需要抢6c1f 或者1c6f。如果第三回合踩4c3f，第四回合可以安稳拿到4c2f或者2c4f。总之这些砖头要尽早用出去，不然贬值，一般是通过砖扩。搭配：砖扩流，用砖卡如泥潭",,
A141,萝卜农夫,Turnip Farmer,T4,,,カブ農家,没有蔬菜补助的话，若能发动2次，效果还算不错。和日雇组合或小麦组合一起用。选秀时如果转来很多日雇・小麦相关卡，也可以顺势跟着出。,"At the start of the returning home phase of each round, if both the ""Day Laborer"" and ""Grain Seeds"" action spaces are occupied, you get 1 vegetable.","效果：每个回家阶段，如果小麦和临时工行动格都被占据，你获得1菜
强度：抓人卡中几乎是最苛刻的抓人卡，在现版本bga 抓到的概率还高一些，全扩几乎很难同时抓到临工套+麦子套，就算抓到了往往也只能拿到3-6 菜收益，属于条件苛刻收益也不超模
难度：5/5
用法：敏锐地捕获轮抽时别人的麦和临工配合可以扣，等别人都打出来了且确定他们会在相同回合发动你就可以打出这张卡，吃到一些菜的收益。不搭：敌人的流浪汉、少年艺术家等踩完就跑卡",,
A142,编绳工,Cordmaker,T1,,,紐編み,只要在序盘打出就能产出5~6个种子。因为也能买蔬菜，效果不容易变废。一旦有玩家频繁去芦苇，就会立刻失效，所以选牌时要注意芦苇原连携。反过来，场上芦苇辅助太多也会导致发动机会减少。,"Each time any player (including you) takes at least 2 reed from the ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you can choose to take 1 grain or buy 1 vegetable for 2 food.","效果：每当有人踩芦苇池获得至少2r，你支付公共区0/2f买1麦/菜
强度：多麦卡中的佼佼者，相比其他麦子卡有麦子早、给菜的优势。基本上第一季2麦，第2-4 季3 麦，第5-6 季1麦/菜。全局接近5麦1菜收益，相当于省4 动。8 收益。
难度：3/5
用法：你要注意这张卡一定要前两回合出，而且在中期你要自己去踩芦苇池，不要指望别人，因此要扩屋，或者是搭配菜的配合。另外要注意，这张卡踩不起rsf，很多石头卡拿不起。搭配：早麦流茅草等，早菜流魅惑 胡萝卜等不搭：早石如石屋流，三屋流，别人家的拾柴者、河岸林务、河边牧羊、森林审查破坏你触发编绳的卡go_on1217: 这张卡不限制别人踩芦苇才行吗？我脑雾了？EthanHuang: 回复 go_on1217 :自己踩也可以",,
A144,资产扣押者,Sequestrator,T4,,,係争物取り扱い人,在有3个牧场的情况下就算拿到3个芦苇，也几乎只有做篮子这点用处。也就只能在砖很紧缺的局里拿4砖吧,Place 3 reed and 4 clay on this card. The next player to have 3 pastures/5 field tiles get the 3 reed/4 clay (not retroactively).,,,
A145,绳索编制工,Ropemaker,T3,,,綱作り,到第9阶段为止只掉落2个的话，作为增筑补助感觉不太够。若是芦苇很紧缺的场合还算可以。有篮制的话到最后都很香。,"At the end of each harvest, you get 1 reed from the general supply.","效果：每个丰收节段结束时，你获得1r
强度：基本没有强度，被箩筐搬运工吊打，就算是第一季打出，也只能给3 个扩房芦苇和两个翻修芦苇，大概是省2动左右，大概4.5分，略微回本。
难度：1/5
用法：R4 末动或二三季打出，职业套可以打打搭配：利用芦苇的手段如芦苇妻，箩筐编制工",,
A146,库存管理员,Storehouse Steward,T3,,,倉庫管理係,单体来看火力稍显不足。如果其他玩家已经稳稳地确保了饭基盘，那么就只有自己更容易进入渔小剧场，因此能发挥作用。,"Each time you take exactly 2/3/4/5 food from a food accumulation space, you also get 1 stone/reed/clay/wood. (If you take 6 or more food, you do not get a bonus good).","效果：每当你从食物积累行动格拿走恰好2/3/4/5f 时，你获得1s/r/c/w（如果你拿走6f 或更多，你不会因为这张卡获得奖励）
强度：这张卡如果没有强势配合，强度是不回本的。因为就算每个4f 都给你去拿，你也只能拿到6 个c。而就算是拿到6 个w都强度有些不够，6 个c还要看别人脸色，因为所有的4/5f都让你拿到是不现实的。因此这张卡单卡必然亏本，只能作为配合卡。如此严格的出场条件，这张卡应该是在评级时忽略他的价值分析而高估了，现在认为应该是T4 强度。
难度：2/5
用法：必须要有强如首发鱼叉的卡，才能让他强度脱离白板，首发鱼叉的情况下，这张卡可以拿到5s1r左右。最好还得有强化卖艺的卡，如少年艺术家+房屋艺术家，再加上鱼叉，才有出场机会。应当是T4 卡。搭配：钓鱼套，卖艺套",,
A148,牧羊业者,Woolgrower,T4,,,綿羊飼い,搭配能发挥羊作用的卡一起用，虽然羊可以繁殖，但在得分或食料方面回报并不大，这点比较难。由于阶段顺序是食料供给→繁殖，所以即使在食料供给前养到最大数量，繁殖后也不用把它们放走。,This card can hold a number of sheep equal to the number of completed feeding phases.,"效果：你可以在这张卡牌上养羊，但不能超过已过的喂养阶段数。（因此在第一季的繁殖阶段，这张卡就可以养1羊了）
强度：饲养空间，况且是少得可怜的羊的饲养空间，价值是很少的。更何况这张卡在第一季不能繁殖，只能第二季繁殖阶段提供的两个饲养空间才构成繁殖空间，也就是说你不仅要拿到首锅，还要拿到第二季的羊才能繁殖。那我为什么不打个4w卡，在扩屋时开2马厩呢？比2马厩净亏2分，单卡严重不回本。
难度：1/5
用法：非职业套或配合不要用搭配：几乎没有能用的配合，前期需要动物的卡勉强可以搭配",,
A149,房屋艺术家,House Artist,T1,,,塗装美術家,用小行动进行增筑+芦苇减免。像奇术师等的小剧场Combo搭配起来也很优秀。要时刻警惕有没有人来小剧场捡饭。,"Each time you use the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you also get a ""Build Rooms"" action. Each room you build during the action costs you 1 reed less.","效果：卖艺时可以造房子，因此造的每间房子减少1r花费
强度：如果没有别人卡3f 卖艺的情况下，比木扩还要强。因为他虽然多花了四五根木头，但是多拿了6-9 饭，并且不卡扩屋格，是合算的买卖。也就是说可以认为是差不多木扩的强度，算是中等T1水准。但是实战中经常会有人第三回合踩卖艺，因此房屋艺术家过于限制玩家的行动，增加了玩家的风险，因此和木扩各有千秋。
难度：4/5
用法：R1学无子嗣开局，3w+2w，R2可以拿rsf/2r，职业这种。R3 一动扩。如果R1-2没有拿齐我说的材料，那就只能R3的2动扩屋，陷入被卡的风险，因此房屋艺术家特别适合打牛杖，可以R2抢先拿r，R3 一动扩屋。在游戏中期，房屋艺术家尽量保持着3 饭卖艺的节奏，理想的节奏是R3、R6、R9，如果被卡卖艺也不要因小失大，可以接受1f 卖艺扩屋为了早生。搭配：房屋艺术家是每间房屋无条件减费卡，几乎可以和任意扩卡搭配，比如房艺砌砖支柱，可以1w扩屋。房艺木扩可以不需要r扩木屋。卖艺强化卡如港口商贩，少年艺术家。多屋流卡牌如温馨家庭，针线编制工都是好配合。不搭：注意房艺必须卖艺格子扩屋才有收益，所以虽然可以和木扩联动，但是不能和木贸联动",,
A150,舞台布景工,Stagehand,T3,,,舞台の裏方,如果看起来第4R会有玩家去小剧场的话，可以作为增筑补助打出，以争取最速增员。只要哪怕一次有效活用，就能发挥相当于1手的作用，所以判断时机很重要。,"Each time another player uses the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you can take your choice of a ""Build Fences"", ""Build Stables"", or ""Build Rooms"" action.","效果：每当其他玩家使用卖艺累积行动格时，你可以选择执行一次“围栅栏”/“造马厩”/“建造房屋”行动。
强度：基本上是扩一间屋子，围1次，可以省2动，是可以回本的，但是可能被敌方卡。
难度：4/5
用法：轮抽时一般看到别人有卖艺套再选，比如说别人选房屋艺术家，你就可以选舞台布景工捉他，然后一定要比下家先凑齐建筑材料，最好要拿到R2的2r，R1可以考虑3w，2w或者3w抢先。这样子你就比他赚了。搭配：钓鱼套，别人的卖艺套，篱笆护理、温馨家庭等强化栅栏、房子、马厩行动的卡",,
A151,吟游诗人,Minstrel,T3,,,吟遊楽人,相当不稳定。未行动的家族只有自己，并且是在能确定发动的场合下打出这张卡也不算坏吧。因为并不是在使用行动格，所以也很难纳入连招。由于不包含翻面的回合卡，因此例如第一手打出的话就能放入1R的行动格。,"At the start of each returning home phase, if only one action space card on round space 1 to 4 is unoccupied, you can use that action space.","效果：每个回家阶段，如果R1-4的行动格均已翻开，且其中恰好3 个被占据，你可以使用未被占据的那个行动格而无需派遣家庭成员。
强度：如果你建立了人口压制或者对于其他人的行动了如指掌，这张卡可以给你省下2-4 个行动，每多省下一个行动就额外2分收益，打得好大概4-8 收益。
难度：5/5
用法：第三四季打出，职业套或者人口压制优先打出，此外可以配合1-4 回合的触发卡牌搭配：1-4 回合的触发相应卡牌，人口压制卡，职业套等",,
A152,夜校学生,Night-School Student,T2,,,夜学生,如果其他玩家打出了能在个人教师或教师桌等非职业格子上出现职业的卡，就更容易发动。反过来，如果出了赞助人或交易教师之类的，就很难发挥。,"Each returning home phase in which no player returns a person from a ""Lessons"" action space, you can play an occupation for an occupation cost of 1 food.","效果：每回合回家阶段，如果没有任何玩家家庭成员从职业训练回家，你可以支付1f 打出一张职业
强度：上线乞丐学徒T0 强度，甚至比乞丐学徒节奏更快，平均卡越弱、大家越有其他打职业手段，这张卡就越强。也就是说讲桌、私人教师、夜校碰在一起，夜校最强。下线只能打1-2张职业，勉强回本T3 卡。因此平均抓位T2没问题，属于拿了看情况出。
难度：3/5
用法：第1-2回合打出的话，3-7 回合就可能触发1-2次。第8-14 回合触不触发要看整体职业强弱与职业流卡牌的分布，是一张根据轮抽决定抓不抓，根据场面决定打不打的“抓人卡”。如果已经可以触发， 要注意1饭的要求和规划好哪些回合出哪些职业。轮抽职业弱这张卡就强，因为很多职业不一定值得1动打，但大部分都值得1f 打。搭配：职业流，其他玩家的不在职业格打职业的卡，场上职业整体弱不搭：其他人的职业流，其他人要求在职业格打职业的卡（贸易导师，畜牧导师），场上整体职业强",,
A153,养猪大户,Pig Owner,T2,,,豚持ち,猪5匹只要能顺利繁殖，即使没有辅助也能轻松瞄准的范围。,"The first time after you play this card that you have 5 wild boars on your farm, you immediately get 3 bonus points.","效果：游戏结束时，如果你有至少5 猪，你获得3 分
强度：几乎总是弱于牧场帮手1分，完成难度确实这张卡更难一点点，因此这张卡是弱T2，而牧场帮手是强T2
难度：3/5
用法：如果没有猪手段（如陷阱修建工）最晚第四季就要围，然后养2猪，自动变5 猪。搭配：猪手段，早围流",,
A154,薪资主管,Paymaster,T4,,,主計官,如果出了大量小麦，而且还有玩渔业combo的玩家的话……作为其他玩家，如果还能额外拿到小麦，就更容易去渔业小剧场了。,"Each time another player uses a food accumulation space, you can give them 1 grain from your supply to get 1 bonus point.","效果：每当其他人使用食物积累行动格，你可以支付他1麦，你获得1分
强度：一般大家是4f时去食物积累，但是有麦子的话可能2-3f 就去了。考虑最优情况，每个人2f时去食物积累，每人去2次，相当于你要在R8 打出薪资主管并且有麦子机制，用6 麦子，刷6 分。那么对手每人获得2麦，4 分。你支出6 麦至少3-4 分了，亏本生意。
难度：4/5
用法：这张卡已经超出了没配合不用了，已经弱于白板职业了，建议就算凑职业打出也尽量不发动效果，除非麦子溢出或者给到非竞争对手，否则发动效果就是弱于白板职业了。",,
A156,采购员,Buyer,T2,,,買い付け人,拿下厨房后只要买羊猪饭就会增加。尽早拉栅栏，争取实现2种繁殖。,"Each time another player uses a reed, stone, sheep, or wild boar accumulation space, you can pay them 1 food to get 1 good of the respective type from the general supply.","效果：每当其他玩家踩芦苇、石头、猪、羊累计行动时，你可以支付他1f 来从公共区获得一种对应商品。
强度：第一季和第三季打出各有千秋，我们按照第三季打出计算收益，你相当于大概可以用9f 买2s，1r，3 羊，3猪，而每个对手获得3f，因此相当于付出12f买2s，1r，3 羊，3猪，在大锅的情况下，动物繁殖后基本可以和花的食物抵消，大概认为是白得4 分+2s1r，也就是大概6 下限分，但是考虑到大锅本身拥有成本，因此大概T2强度。
难度：4/5
用法：两种打法，第一季或者第三季打出。第一季打出的话，要求你关键时候扣住rsf 让别人去2r，然后你第一季最好要买两次，第二季也最好要买两次，最好要有前期食物手段支持购买，第三季再起锅养活自己。这种情况下要多买芦苇扩建，期望生得多。如果是第三季打出，更适合前期职业位紧张或者前期饿的情况。补动物分早围，补翻修建材。由于买不了牛注意扣牛。搭配：第一季打出要求早期食物手段，5 屋流卡，无论什么时候打出都配合早围卡，牛卡。需求锅的卡。不搭：芦、石、猪、羊其他手段。",,
A157,波西尼亚人,Bohemian,T3,,,ボヘミアン,第2阶段以后，两种职业都被占满的情况很少，所以能有还不错的发挥。不过一旦有走职业系combo的玩家，就会突然变得不太启动。其他玩家如果打出了家教或教师桌等在非职业格也能出职业的卡，就更容易触发。要注意，如果自己出了很多张职业，那就会相应更难触发。,"At the start of each returning home phase, if at least one ""Lessons"" action space is unoccupied, you get 1 food.",,,
A158,烹饪艺术家,Culinary Artist,T4,,,台所の芸術家,时机虽不稳定，但前期羊饭能做到6饭很优秀。如果有小剧场combo的话，也能成为还不错的饭基盘，所以想先打出来。,"Each time another player uses the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you can exchange your choice of 1 grain/sheep/vegetable for 4/5/7 food.",,,
A159,航海木匠,Joiner of the Sea,T3,,,海の指物師,食物效率还算可以，但会把木头送给对手是个缺点。建议与树木园丁或森林交易人等能把食物转化为资源的卡牌搭配使用。,"Each time another player uses the ""Fishing""/""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you can give them 1 wood to get 2 food/3 food from the general supply.","效果：每当其他玩家使用钓鱼、芦苇池行动格时，你可以支付他一个w来从公共供应区获得2/3f
强度：又称之为海贼王，是弱化的刨工台，全局触发六次芦苇池、三次钓鱼相当于12w换24f，采菇一般也就8w换16f，因此航海木匠可以看做1.5 倍采菇，是更高效的w换f 卡，但是与采菇相比的弱点是没有直接的搭配，而且如果R1打不出来的话，很容易看别人脸色。是条件更苛刻、更没有配合的、单卡更强的采菇
难度：3/5
用法：R1打出，踩木头，然后扣紧rsf搭配：自己的加强rsf的卡，别人的加强芦苇钓鱼的卡不搭：自己的啤酒池等加强自己的钓鱼芦苇的卡，别人的零售商等加强别人的rsf的卡",,
A161,土地看护者,Patch Caretaker,T3,,,菜園の世話人,启动两次就能回本，但没那么容易就能启动。在木头/砖/食料的格子上可以瞄准启动。如果无论如何都想要蔬菜，那就出吧。,"Each time you use an accumulation space while already having used another accumulation space for the same type of good that work phase, you also get 1 vegetable.",,,
A162,林木清点工,Forest Tallyman,T4,,,森の監督者,黏土桩因为需要占用1砖的空间，所以发动机会比较少。想要运用的话，要么自己进行砖强化，要么以搭便车的形式利用正在做的人。要是有砖的消耗去向就更好了。若是出了作为强力田地辅助的破碎犁，活跃机会会大幅增加。,"Each time both the ""Forest"" and ""Clay Pit"" accumulation spaces are occupied, you can use the gap between them as an action space to get 2 clay and 3 wood.",,,
A163,建筑专家,Building Expert,T3,,,熟練建築家,资材市场是很受欢迎的空间，所以很难稳定发动。能获得的资材也多种多样，因此很难制定方针。,"Each time you use the ""Resource Market"" action space with the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th person you place, you also get 1 wood/clay/reed/stone/stone.","效果：每当你派遣你的第1/2/3/4/5 个家庭成员（也就是你第几动去）去使用建材市场，你额外获得1w/c/r/s/s
强度：强度有限，就算你完全不去芦苇池，你也就平均扩2屋翻2次，不超过6 建材收益，伐木工水平
难度：3/5
用法：前期拿木，后期拿石，但是注意如果前两回合打不出来就尽量别出了，容易被上家针对死搭配：强化rsf的卡，如零售商，弱化芦苇池或矿场的卡，如临时员工，河岸建筑师不搭：强度芦苇池和矿场的卡，如啤酒池，采石钳",,
A164,森林工人,Wood Worker,T4,,,柴刈り,搭配能发挥羊繁殖效果的卡牌一起,"Each time you take wood from an accumulation space, you can exchange 1 wood for 1 sheep. Place the wood on the accumulation space.","效果：每当你使用木头积累行动格，可以把1w留在格子上，获取1羊
强度：弱化版采菇人。采菇的发动时机就是前期多发动，然后不起锅，你这张牌需要起锅才能等同采菇，还不能在起锅前的r1/2多触发，是很不搭配的。在中后期使用的话，拿木头的机会就少了，几乎一定不回本。
难度：4/5
用法：有职业套可以早做出来饲养空间养羊，一般情况下别用这张卡搭配：腌制工勉强可以搭配，弱组合，两张卡抵一个强化采菇",,
A166,牧草晾晒工,Haydryer,T2,,,草干し,如果是能多次经过栅栏的手牌，就能高效率地购买。牧场有1头牛的状态下只要在13R出一次，也能包含繁殖在内增加到牛5头。牧场为0也可以购买,"Immediately before each harvest, you can buy 1 cattle for 4 food minus 1 food for each pasture you have. (The minimum cost is 0).","效果：每个丰收阶段，你可以花4f 买1牛，你每有一圈地，减免1f，最多减免到0f。
强度：第四季围的话，白得1+2+2牛，一共 5牛，相当于4 饭4 分，但这个4 分是下限分。
难度：2/5
用法：第四季或者更早围4 个圈地，如果前三季围可以先围2-3 圈地就打出养牛。搭配：牛计分卡如挤奶凳、牧牛贵族、畜牧士官、饲料室等",,
A167,种畜采购商,Breeder Buyer,T4,,,種畜買い付け人,条件比较苛刻，回报也很小。就算一口气建好厩，家畜也只能领到1只。,"Each time you build at least 1 wood/clay/stone room and at least 1 stable on the same turn, you also get 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle.",,,
A168,畜牧教师,Animal Teacher,T2,,,動物訓練士,只要有炉灶就是赞助人。每回都吃的话就是劣化版赞助人，所以尽早确保其他的饭基盘，建立繁殖体制吧。打出这张卡的时机也能买家畜。,"Immediately after each time you use a ""Lessons"" action space, you can also buy 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle for 0/1/2 food.","效果：当你使用职业训练格后，你可以用0/1/2f购买1羊/猪/牛。
强度：对比着供应商设计的卡，出锅前略弱于供应商，出锅后略强于供应商，轻易12f卡排",,
A002,走耕,Shifting Cultivation,T2,,,移動耕作,农田按每张折算2分，所以不容易到终盘就变废。从序中盘开始播种时也很优秀。,Immediately plow 1 field.,"费用：2f
效果：传递卡，立刻犁1 田
强度：和手推犁差不多，是1 分+播种价值的 卡，属于弱T2
难度：1/5
用法：攒好食物打就行，推荐第五季抢先打， 在食物最便宜、抢先最大的时候用出 配合：农业流，百搭",,
A005,陶土堤坊,Clay Embankment,T3,,,粘土積み場,如果偶然出了砖6，也可以把打出去纳入考虑范围内,You immediately get 1 clay for every 2 clay you already have in your supply.,"费用：1f
效果：传递卡，你每有2c，立即获得1c（向下 取整）。
强度：一般来讲，这张卡很难获得过高的收 益，那我们怎么界定这个界限呢？我们认为， 如果你达到了3 屋翻修成砖屋打壁炉，还能再 扩一间的砖头数量，再不翻扩就迟了时机。因 为早点翻扩可以早点生。因此，我们有3+4+5 砖就总够了，也就是12 砖，也就是这张卡在 8c时打出差不多就达到收益顶峰了，也就是4c 的收益，大概2 分净收益。
难度：3/5
用法：一般我们认为这样中期大量得砖卡，都 是为了翻扩砖屋。但是砖的掌控是游戏的高级 技巧，很多elo500 分，世界前一百的专家都用 不太好砖。我可以大致说一下思路，在第一季 时拿一次4c，在第二季拿一次4-6c，然后生第 一个娃打陶土堤，然后翻修出壁炉或火炉或烤 炉或砖工，然后扩一间砖再生。 搭配：其他大量得砖卡，控砖工套",,
A009,幼畜市场,Young Animal Market,T3,,,子供の動物市場,拿到羊繁殖，并且有1头牛时想打出。,"You immediately get 1 cattle. (Effectively, you are exchanging 1 sheep for 1 cattle.)","费用：1 羊
效果：传递卡，1 牛
强度：跟市场摊位同理，用繁殖后的羊换繁殖 前的牛，最大收益1.5分，但是比市场摊位更容 易达到最大收益。
难度：2/5
用法：四五季或更早围，抓至少2 羊，然后繁 殖1 羊，或者不繁殖直接抢先换牛，补牛的2 分。 搭配：早围圈羊流",,
A012,饮水槽,Drinking Trough,T4,C,,水飲み桶,在7本2格牧场中就能进行2种繁殖。有机农业者与Combo,Each of your pastures (with or without a stable) can hold up to 2 more animals.,"费用：1c
效果：你的每个圈地的饲养空间+2（无论有无 马厩）
强度：饲养空间如果提供了繁殖空间，每繁殖 一次就获得了0.5-1 分，考虑到0.5 分成本，因 此如果触发繁殖就有正收益
难度：2/5
用法：轮抽时估算自己什么时候围，动物什么 时候养多少，这张卡想要发挥价值需要严密的 规划，但是打出时很简单，算好这个1c不影响 别的翻修什么的，就打就行 搭配：有机农，有机农给每个有剩余3 饲养空 间的有动物圈地记分，因此很需要4 饲养空间 的圈地","Drinking Trough Drinking Trough It's important to note that a stable is superior
to a Drinking Trough until you have at least 2 pastures. This is a significant
weakness, since early pastures are usually a bad deal. The reason for this is
that if you compare a single pasture to 2 stables, you can hold the same amount
of animals, but the stables can be built as a 'free' action when you
build rooms. The pasture, on the other hand, requires a full action on its own. That said, the Drinking Trough is still very
efficient at increasing your animal capacity once you have a couple of small
pastures up. While the improvement is often a mistake to play early, it can be
a nice play in the mid to late game if you haven't built stables yet.",
A016,夯实粘土,Rammed Clay,T1,,,踏み粘土,砖块辅助会变成栅栏辅助。注意：如果其他玩家打出的话，砖块会更容易被拿走。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 clay. You can use clay instead of wood to build fences.","效果：打出时获得1c，围栅栏时可以用c当w 使用
强度：我们要注意一些问题。首先，牲畜一开 始的2 分是谁赋予的呢？是不是因为有居住环 境才会有人拿啊，谁也不会为了在房子里放一 只羊而前期拿羊吧。因此，我们合理的认为， 所有前期提供居住环境的卡，首先隐性地为每 种动物提供了初始的1 分，因为这让这些动物 的价值变得平滑，在前期就可以拿，而不是R6 再跟其他补元素的人抢，而居住环境提供的生 育价值我们暂时则不分析。那么，单独的居住 环境为单独的动物提供1 分，三个以上的居住 环境就有着3 分。而壁炉火炉则可认为是一个 单独的居住环境，并因此有着1 分的隐性收 益。因为有了它，你可以拿4 羊然后烹饪三 个，没有它，你只能扔掉三个。 栅栏的高效我们刚刚还提到，不过我们还要再 思考一下。首先，栅栏的直接得分不是围地面 积，而是圈地数量。而圈地数量也决定了14回 合独立动物的获取前提。首先你的房子提供了 第一种独立动物的居住空间，那么第一个圈地 提供了第二种，价值从2 分提升到了3 分，同 时考虑到一个圈地平均有2 格面积，那么此时 的圈地是5 分。第二个圈地提供了第三种动物 的居住空间，拥有着1 分居住分+1 分面板分+2 分空地分=4 分。而第三四个圈地，不再提供居 住价值，而只有着额外动物的边际价值，但是 这种边际价值往往下降，我们可以认为多余的 居住空间赋予了动物平滑的边际价值，而不是 多余的居住空间本身有着价值。那么第三个圈 地有着1 分面板分+2 分空地分=3 分。再考虑第 四个圈地时，木头不够用了，因此是1 分面板 分=1 分。因此圈地的价值大概是5/4/3/1 分， 而消耗的木头大概为6/4/4/1 木，我们可以发 现，木头在14 回合围栅栏时，拥有着1 木略低 于1 分的水平，而且拥有着极其平滑的性质， 让你可以先花大钱、再花零钱，基本上每一木 都能利用上，这是极其高效的。 回到正题，我们花费了14c换取了15 木，14c 的价值近似在7-10 分左右，强化为了13-15 分，收益在3-8 分之间。纵使夯实黏土会让c 增值，w贬值，也无伤大雅。
难度：1/5
用法：尽量卷完砖再打出夯实黏土，免得被针 对，围之前的某个次发打出就好 搭配：送砖卡，运土D120，售土，搬运等卡 不搭：烧砖等用砖卡，运木等晚木卡 EthanHuang: 哦忘了，在游戏中期，6c甚至 5c都可以去拿，在游戏后期，如果围还不够， 可以拿4c",,
A019,手推犁,Handplow,T2,,,手押し鋤,田地按1张折算2分。从中盘开始播种时也很优秀。,"Add 5 to the current round and place 1 field tile on the corresponding round space. At the start of that round, you can plow the field.","费用：1w
效果：往之后第五个回合摆1 田，回合开始犁 这个田。
强度：要注意一下，只有建筑资源、食物、动 物、植物算物品，田、房子、人口不算物品， 因此不能触发道德宣传员。此外，这张卡用1w 换2+分，标准的1 分卡，但是考虑到田的播种 重要性，因此放到比T3 略高的位置上。
难度：1/5
用法：别拖到第10 回合再打就行，尽量1-8 回 合打出，这样第五季也能播上 搭配：农业卡",,
A024,打谷板,Threshing Board,T3,C,,脱穀板,如果是田地较轻的场地，就可以作为面包辅助而值得信赖,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"" or ""Cultivation"" action space, you get an additional ""Bake Bread"" action.","条件：2 职业 费用：1w
效果：1 分，每次踩犁田或者犁播行动格时，获 得一次烤面包行动

用法：没配合的话就后期打一下就好","Threshing Board Threshing Board Pretty comparable to the Flail, really, but a
little worse since you're less likely to want to spend 2W in the early game,
even with a VP attached.",
A026,卧室,Sleeping Corner,T2,C,,寝室,一般来说，建好2块小麦田并打出这张卡的时候，增员格子已经不怎么拥挤了，所以基本上这是张在12-13R用于进行即使没有房子也可以的增员的卡。,"You can use any ""Wish for Children"" action space even if it is occupied by one other player's person.","条件：2 麦田 费用：1w

this won't be relevant until FG w/o Room comes out. At that stage, depending on
the number of players, its effect can range from huge to OK. In 2-p, you're
usually better off denying your opponent from the square than passively
preventing yourself from being denied. Is the effect worth getting two grain fields sown
if you're ranching? Probably not, since just getting those two fields sown will
probably cost more actions than the FG w/o Room will give you, and grain is a
pretty terrible way to score points in the end game. However, if you're already
sowing grain, this can be aces in a crowded game.",
A032,马槽,Manger,T3,,,かいば桶,如果是8格牧场，靠2木3分的效果分数效率还算可以。要做成10格牧场的话，因为田地分和种子分不太好赚，所以希望用别的卡拿到大量的盘外分。,"During scoring, if your pastures cover at least 6/7/8/10 farm yard spaces, you get 1/2/3/4 bonus points.","费用：2w
效果：游戏结束时，如果你的圈地占地面积至 少6/7/8/10 格，得1/2/3/4 分。
强度：8 围流专属卡牌，2w换3 分，1+分的净 收益。
难度：2/5
用法：8 围，可以考虑116，或者 44 两种围 法，116 的优势是多1木多一分，如果造2 马 厩可以养满三种动物，适合木头多预期动物也 多的情况。44 相反，一开始就可以养两种动 物，适合早围早卷动物，木头少的情况。

A033,大农庄,Big Country,T0,,,新しい土地,和小农民、耕耘锄、耕作者之类搭配成一套。也有在终盘以2分4饭左右打出的展开。,"For each complete round left to play, you immediately get 1 bonus point and 2 food.","条件：农场全部空格已填满费用：无（以后不写费用默认费用无）
效果：对于每个未开始的回合，立即获得1分+2f。
强度：弱T0卡，大家越弱他越强，不轮抽和7抽7的神卡，稳定50-55分。单论强度的话，R6打出可以拿到8分16饭，相当于16分，但是限制了生，所以如果有魅惑、情圣、篷车这种超生卡，就会异常强势，因为这张卡带来了16分的价值却几乎没有损耗。
难度：2/5
用法：这张卡一旦学会，是新手赢专家的最简单手段。没有扩屋卡的情况下最适合走2屋大农，这样来，前六回合的行动基本是固定的。每回合你优先一动拿3+的木头，2动拿田。如果偶尔拿不到木头，可以拿3+的食物熬过第一季。这样来，在R6前容易作出4田12木9围，在有栽培的情况下容易R5作出。在某些情况下，你可以选择为了拿3+羊而晚一回合打出大农庄，你也可以偶尔选择3田或5田。总之尽量不要晚于R6打出。如果在你想打大农的回合上家抢先了，不要吝啬一动用主发格子打大农，因为被卡了一回合大农就是2分的收益。在轮抽时，你可以多选择一些耗费食物的卡如杂货商，在打出大农后产生了价值。你最好在二三季拿到2+羊繁殖起来，这样到终局就是接近满分的羊，在3-5季，你要饲养第二种动物，才能拿到足够的动物分。如果你有足够的次要发展卡，可以在R11抢先，如果R12出的不是求子心切，就R12一动抢先。但是大多数情况下，你可以R11不抢先，而是R12一动抢先，更加稳妥。此外要注意的是，轮抽时在基础包中大农庄有很多配合，往往都在T4，要留意扣下，如瓶瓶罐罐、马槽、样板工（需要配合小户农），雕塑、羊毛毯、警官、栽培、板犁等等。搭配：超生卡如情圣，干草棚，扩屋卡如尊贵支柱，木匠，彻底重建，样例马厩建造者、2房卡如农孩、小户农不搭：任何第一季必须打出的卡，除了小户农
变体：3房大农、4房大农、超生大农、重建大农、样例马厩大农",,
A038,羊毛毯,Wool Blankets,T4,,,羊の毛布,羊在繁殖空间上的得分较低。由于不改建的部分也会减少房屋分，因此务必准备好除此之外的得分来源。,"During scoring, if you live in a wooden/clay/stone house by then, you get 3/2/0 bonus points.","条件：5 只羊

A044,塘边小屋,Pond Hut,T3,,,池の小屋,相对于条件和成本来说效果偏朴素。虽说有1VP，但必须在前期打出，也不是那种特别想优先打出的效果。,"Place 1 food on each of the next 3 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.","条件：恰好2 职业 费用：1w
效果：1 分，往之后的3 回合各铺1f，回合开 始获得
强度：10 抽7 环境下，这张卡的打出时机一般 是1-4 季，1w大概不小于1 分，可以相抵消， 主要的收益在于3f，也就是2 分左右的收益。
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡的难点在于卡职业，使用时需要 计划好各种各样的生娃情况，是5 生、6 生、7 生分别怎么办，规划好第一季和第二季打哪些 职业，争取做到第二季抢生时顺手打出，拿到 的饭正好喂饱娃，收益拉满。",,
A050,牛奶罐,Milk Jug,T3,,,ミルクつぼ,终盘即使是牛1也经常会有人去，所以会出相当多的食料。如果看起来没人会去牛1，就想让自己也能去。,"Each time any player (including you) uses the ""Cattle Market"" accumulation space, you get 3 food, and each other player gets 1 food.","费用：1c
效果：每当有人踩牛累积行动时，除你以外的 玩家获得1f，你获得3f。
强度：看有没有1 牛手段了，如果你有强力的 每回合踩1 牛的手段，这张卡可以带来8-10f， 相当于4+的净收益。如果没有的话，这张卡一 般也就触发3 次，可以带来2-3 分左右的净收 益，是很不错的卡，可能可以到T2 的位置。
难度：1/5
用法：这张卡是补中后期食物压力的强大卡， 如果你觉得自己中后期食物有压力，或者你有 办法度过前期食物压力而全局不起锅，这张卡 是不二之选。注意要在三四季打出的话，要提 前在二三季算好1c的筹备。 配合：木质乳清桶，畜牧士，牲畜交易，宠物 爱好，牛蹄护理等踩牛累积卡",,
A053,陶制烟斗,Claypipe,T3,,,陶器パイプ,蘑菇寻找・森林锄地等，拿取一次后又放回版面上的资源也计数。森林守护者是最佳搭档。有篮筐制作所等把资源转换为食物的卡的话，自然会更倾向于收集更多资源，因此陶制烟斗的触发机会也会增加。,"In the returning home phase of each round, if you gained at least 7 building resources in the preceding work phase, you get 2 food.","费用：1c
效果：每个回家阶段，如果你在刚才的工作阶 段获得了不少于7 建筑资源，你获得2f。

难度：3/5
用法：轮抽时工作阶段给大量资源或换资源的 卡，适合早扩流，二三季打出。如果生不到四 人也没配合，可以四五季打出。 搭配：工作阶段给大量资源的卡如五金商店， 换资源的卡如硬陶瓷，换的建筑资源也计入7 个的计算。 不搭：回合开始获得的资源不计算数量，要注 意。",,

用法：轮抽时多拿木头次发，如果有着急第二 季打的木头次发，那就要第一季拿两次rsf，在 抢生前期就打出锯木厂，生娃时打木头次发就 好。如果次发卡都不着急而且前期职业不过3 张，可以考虑先控井再打锯木厂，鱼与熊掌都 要。 搭配：木头次发，切石，强化资源市场的职业 不搭：木材专家，除非有很多3 木卡",,
A078,独木舟,Canoe,T3,,,カヌー,如果芦苇很重的局面，即使单体也足够优秀。如果是要多次去捕鱼的情况，就拿篮筐制作吧,"Each time you use the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, you get an additional 1 food and 1 reed.","条件：1 职业 费用：2w
效果：1 分，每次你使用钓鱼累计行动格时，你 额外获得1f+1r
强度：本身亏1 分，但是每次触发都赚1 分左 右，无配合的话全局触发两次可以净赚1 分， 有配合触发5 次可以净赚4 分左右。
难度：3/5
用法：第一季准备好配合、扩屋资源、额外2 木，第二季生娃打出钓鱼，然后三四季抢一下 芦苇工坊。 搭配：钓鱼套",,
A080,采石钳,Stone Tongs,T4,B,,石ばさみ,还算不错的石头补助。基本上2石不会被拿太多，但3石往往会变得很热门，所以我想先用2石进去。,"Each time you use a stone accumulation space, you get 1 additional stone.","费用：1w
效果：每当你踩石头积累行动格时，额外获得 一个石头
强度：可以看作1w换0-2s，也就是-1 到1 之 间的收益。
难度：1/5
用法：没配合就早点打就好，当然不能影响收 益更高的前期卡，如果有消耗石头的手段，可 以更优先抓这张卡。 搭配：消耗石头的手段如雕塑课程、家具商、 士兵。石头积累配合卡如石材公司、石头打磨 工。","Stone Tongs Stone Tongs This is fantastic and compares very favorably to
cards like Stone Cart and Stone Exchange. Not only does it encourage you to
deny your opponents stone, but it also gives the stone up front, so that you
can use it immediately.",
A083,牧羊杖,Shepherd's Crook,T3,C,,羊飼いの杖,木14根做4格牧场×2的话就是4只羊,"Each time you fence a new pasture covering at least 4 farmyard spaces, you immediately get 2 sheep on this pasture.","费用：1w
效果：每当你围出一个面积不少于4 的圈地 时，在这个圈地内放2 羊（一个行动内可以多 次触发）
强度：正常的5 屋2田8 围或者4 屋3 田8围 等流派，可以吃到4 羊收益，基本上有3-5 分 价值，现在看来有T2 或者强T3 的水准。
难度：2/5
用法：基本上是要围14 木8 格圈地的，也可以 前期先围一个8 木4 格圈地把羊先养起来。 搭配：彻底重建（重新围栅栏，可以在原有基 础上多围3 木），先围11 木，拿2 羊，再彻底 重建围14 木，拿4 羊，总共收益6 羊。牧羊人 B104，织布机，黄油桶等用羊卡。","Shepherd's Crook Shepherd's Crook 2 sheep for 1 wood is an amazing deal, pure and
simple. Unfortunately, the huge requirement of wood (9!) prevents this from
being useful in the early game. If you're planning on using sheep for early
food, you probably have better options. However, for someone who's found a way
to eat early without sheep, you can't beat this efficiency as part of a mid to
late game fence play.",
A086,驯兽师,Animal Tamer,T3,C,,調教師,因为在中盘把繁殖体系搭好后，最后就更容易一口气把栅栏拉起来，因此更容易提升家畜点。因为能拿到小麦，所以不太容易吃亏，这点很开心。和牛的王子之间的Combo非常强力。,"When you play this card, you immediately get your choice of 1 wood or 1 grain. Instead of just 1 animal total, you can keep any 1 animal in each room of your house.","效果：打出时获得1麦或1木，然后你的每个房子都可以养殖一个动物，而不是只能养殖一个。
强度：中期的饲养空间每3个价值1分，为什么这么说呢？因为三个空间就可以让一类动物繁殖而不用仍了，那么，在四房时打出驯兽师，本身就有着1分红利，此外，麦子也有着2分，可见稳定收益就有3分，十分稳健值得打出。而且，他还能够提高游戏末的饲养空间上限，让动物多的玩家不需要打马厩，也省了木头和行动。
难度：3/5
用法：前中期扩到3后就可以打出，最好第二季或者第三季开始养2羊，然后每季煮了吃。或者可以等扩到5时打出，拿两种动物顺便补围。配合：15石屋套","Animal Tamer Playing him immediately gives you an extra stable and quickly becomes an extra
pasture after that (sans VPs). Usually worth it if you plan to get to 4 rooms
or more, since it lets you avoid spending precious wood and actions on early
fences/stables. Instead, you get to do what you want to do anyway - build more
rooms!",
A087,管理员,Conservator,T2,A,,修理屋,在砖头很重的场合尤其开心。石匠连携也更容易瞄准。有资材的话也可以进行砖头改建,You can renovate your wooden house directly to stone without renovating it to clay first.,"效果：木屋翻修可以翻石屋强度：这卡就算没有任何配合，也可以省下 4 砖 1 芦1 优质动，前者加起来至少有 5 分。而你损失的只有一次主发机会。大部分情况下，主发打一次就用光石头了，所以不用担心，你只损失了一次次发机会。这样看来收益至少 4 分。他真正强在两点：大家抢翻修时你可以不抢也能翻修到石屋。另外，你可以很早打出石屋卡，就算你是四房。主要你后几手抓到学者B097*，御犁 A090*等，这把游戏将十分快乐。
难度：2/5
用法：有配合四房翻修，没配合第五季出。
搭配：石屋套
不搭：任何拿主发的套路，任何翻修奖励卡 比如采矿锤 娴熟翻修
变体：有一种套路是用管理员卡掉别人的翻修，净收益增加 5 分左右。别人看你没砖，放心不翻修，然后你 R13 抢先管理员，占掉最后一回合翻修，对方就傻眼了。新卡环境下 翻修变得更加简单 这张卡会下调到 T2 左右","Conservator Obviously redonkulous. This saves youâ€š what? 1 reed, 3-5 clay, and 1 renovation
action? Absurd. One supposed weakness to the occ is that you don't get to play a free
Major/Minor Improvement. However, this isn't a valid concern. Let's compare
someone who renovates fairly and someone who uses the Conservator and then
spends an action on the Major/Minor Improvement space. The 'fair' player: Spends 2 actions renovating Spends about 1 action collecting 3-5 clay Spends about 1/2 of an action collecting 1 reed The Conservator: Spends 1 action playing the Conservator Spends 1 action renovating Spends 1 action playing major/minor improvement Even in this case the Conservator is better (he saves about half an action).
However, the Conservator has 2 additional benefits on top of that: 1) You don't have to buy the Major improvement if there is a more efficient way
of gaining points. For instance, rather than spending 1A on 3 stone and 1A on
Major/Minor to get a well, you can just plow 2 fields. 2) You can wait until much later to renovate. Because of the limited number of
renovation spots, the 'fair' player needs to renovate to clay fairly
early if he wants to get to stone. That means he also has to collect clay and
reed fairly early. The Conservator can just wait until the last possible
moment. I have played this card literally every time I've gotten him, and I'm pretty
sure I've never made a mistake in doing so. In competitive games where
resources are tight, he has singlehandedly won me the game by ensuring me a
stone renovation that otherwise would have been impossible. That's a good sign
of a five star card.",
A088,篱笆护理员,Hedge Keeper,T4,C,,生け垣管理人,只要哪怕去一次柵，就相当于干了3木的活，回本了。也能在改筑柵的空间触发。和腹心の友等进行「柵の建設」行动的卡片联动。,"Each time you take a ""Build Fences"" action, you do not have to pay wood for 3 of the fences you build.","效果：每次执行修栅栏行动时，可以省3木
强度：早围卡，这张卡应当是有T3强度的，当时低估了放到T4。这张卡打出来就是要围2-3次的，围第二次和第三次都是拿不到3木，只能拿到2木的强化弱动，只有第一次围是货真价实的3w收益，因此3w+1w或3w+1w+1w收益，也就是3-5收益。
难度：2/5
用法：这张卡应该在第四季甚至更早围第一次，然后动物放不下时及时围第二次补充。轮抽时如果有别的篱笆卡就会很舒服，如木材贸易商。
变体：密友B093 篱笆，强势组合，省12w+1动，比T0卡密友、线人都要强势","Hedge Keeper If you build fences twice, this is worth 6 wood. Not a bad deal if you want a
lot of fences.",
A090,御犁者,Plow Driver,T2,E,,鋤職人,在石家系卡牌之中也是卡牌强度较高的一张。如果是田地辅助较少的对局环境，优先级会相当高。,"Once you live in a stone house, at the start of each round, you can pay 1 food to plow 1 field.","效果：如果你住在石屋，每回合开始可以花1f犁1田
强度：每触发一次收益1.5分，满收益可以达到8以上，石屋套都不可小觑
难度：3/5
用法：和学者B097类似，但是不那么着急，第四季甚至第五季出都行，不一定需要配合，三石屋开始犁就好。搭配：石屋套
变体：学者御，学者打出御的当前回合就可以犁田","Plow Driver This is another card that asks you to get a stone renovation unreasonably
early. He compares unfavorably to the Plow Maker, which isn't even a good card.",
A092,养父母,Adoptive Parents,T3,E,,養父母,只要有饭，最多可以增加3手。有时即使在最快增员时也能加以利用。增员之后再打出这张卡也能发动效果。,"For 1 food, you can take an action with offspring in the same round you get it. If you do, the offspring does not count as ""newborn"".","效果：你在版图上有未长大的孩子时，可以花费1f让他变成长大的孩子，回到房间里，本回合可以使用他。若如此做，喂食阶段，他视为成人。
强度：表面上看是3f换3动，4.5-的收益。但是实际上，如果你每在收获阶段也就是奇数回合生娃使用养父母，都会亏损1f作为喂养。也就是3-4.5的长反馈收益。但是如果你能高效获取食物，又能保障在偶数回合生娃，这张卡收益拉满甚至接近6。
难度：4/5
用法：考验技巧的卡，没有早扩且早食物的话，可能会入不敷出。推荐有扩屋卡+前期食物引擎时使用。如果要使用，请在前六回合打出，不要影响生娃节奏。搭配：扩屋卡，海外援助
变体：养父母+新卡小农民，碰见超生一回合生3娃","Adoptive Parents User Hammerite argues that the card is playable, saying that it gives you 2
actions for the cost of 4 food. He explains: if !supportLineBreakNewLine endif",
A098,马厩艺术家,Stable Architect,T3,,,厩建築士,基本上木材用来做栅栏会更强。用于应对栅栏事故，以及和其他厩系卡牌搭配一起用,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each unfenced stable in your farmyard.","效果：每个不在圈地的马厩计1分。
强度：圈地外的马厩是有用的，因为可以早期养动物，也可以4马厩，后期围4。适合早养动物，后期2/3田的流派。而且是马厩流的提上限卡。超短反馈4分。
难度：2/5
用法：1到4季第一次扩屋时先造几个马厩养动物，第二次扩屋再补到3-4马厩，然后第4-5季可以拿一次1动物吃低保。第5-6季围12木4格，拿最后一种动物，打马厩艺术家。搭配：泥耙等马厩流卡牌不搭：3田以上的犁田卡",,
A102,杂货商,Grocer,T1,B,,小売人,如果有足够的饭基盘会非常强力。等食料基盘稳定后再出会比较稳妥，但在前期就出，去渔小剧场回收木芦的打法也不坏。那种情况下就拿窑来烤面包吧。,"Pile the following goods on this card (wood, grain, reed, stone, vegetable, clay, reed, vegetable). At any time, you can buy the top good for 1 food.","效果：把木麦卢石菜砖卢菜从上到下放到卡牌上，随时可以用1饭换最上面的资源。
强度：最强的食物换分卡，8饭换5建筑材料+1麦+2菜。也就是4分换3.5分+6分，收益可以达到5.5分。一张卡把农业打满分。
难度：4/5
用法：这张卡有两大难度，一是你要在犁播前至少有2田+足够食物供给换到菜。甚至3田+1麦+足够食物；又或者4田+2麦+足够食物，才能把农业打满。另一点难度是不浪费建筑材料，这涉及到两点，一是他的砖出的很晚，你要在翻修砖屋时解决食物问题才能不浪费，但也不能太贪，自己翻修不上才是血亏。另一点送两个芦苇让芦苇很容易浪费，后期尽量谨慎拿rsf（卢石饭）。搭配：犁田卡，食物卡（如烘培陶瓷，书柜烈酒）不搭：其他废食物卡
变体：讲一个窍门 播烤时如果食物不够，可以先烤掉手头的麦子，再换麦子出来播种","Grocer Once you get the grain and the veggie, he's already paid for himself in actions
since normally you have to use a full action to take either. The resources you
get along the way are gravy. That said, you're going to need a good food engine to support him. I've seen at
least a couple of times where someone plays him and then is forced to leave him
unused as they scramble to feed their family. However, provided you are able to support him, he is extremely powerful.",
A108,采菇人,Mushroom Collector,T2,B,,キノコ探し,1木→2饭不是坏的效率。特别是在方向性还没确定的情况下，基本上每次都用这个效果吧。,"Immediately after each time you use a wood accumulation space, you can exchange 1 wood for 2 food. If you do, place the wood on the accumulation space.","效果：去木头积累格可以返还一w到该格，获得2f
强度：这张卡本身近乎无收益，全局1w都接近2f的价值。但他有几个优点，首先第一季不用踩钓鱼卖艺，然后可以多踩木头，让木头贬值，那这张卡本身就获得了价值。最终也是最重要的，打这张卡也在赌木头套装，但凡有个伐木就很舒服，因为伐木和这张卡的触发都会很多次，还能解决食物。
难度：1/5
用法：第一回合打出，然后踩一次2w，两次3w，甚至4w，攒够扩的资源。要注意优先rsf或者2r。搭配：木头套不搭：零工套 其他用木头的卡如造纸 鱼叉猎手这张卡和伐木工都介于弱T2-强T3之间，本质上是赌配合，其实更接近T3","Mushroom Collector Amazingly strong. He's basically a Cabinetmaker that gets to use his ability
every time you take wood. If you play him, you're pretty much taking wood every
time you can. In that time, he generates an absurd amount of food - usually
enough for the first two harvests. He also gives you plenty of wood, of course.
Since you have such a large incentive to take wood, you're taking it much more
often than usual, which balances out the wood you have to leave behind. Mushroom Collector can be risky in 2-p. Because he leaves behind a wood, your
opponent will usually want to take the 4W (a very strong spot for 2-p) and deny
you the food.",
A110,粗轧机,Roughcaster,T4,,,仕立屋,即使增建多块砖房也只能拿到3饭，这点太致命了,"Each time you build at least 1 clay room or renovate your house from clay to stone, you also get 3 food.","效果：每当你扩建至少一间砖屋或者从砖屋翻修到石屋时，获得3f。
强度：饭职业，一局能触发2次就赚了。要至少扩1间砖屋的。基础收益1.5，每多扩一间砖屋，多1.5收益。

用法：砖扩食物卡，早点打，一间间扩就好。搭配：砖扩卡不搭：管理员，木扩卡",,
A111,,Wall Builder,,,,壁装飾人,即使一次增筑2栋，也只会发动1次。在忙着增筑增员的场面里，打出后再下4吃饭有点太悠长。如果有日曜大工或建筑的狮子之类的增筑手压缩，表现还算不错。,"Each time you build at least 1 room, you can place 1 food on each of the next 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
A112,镰刀工,Scythe Worker,T4,,,大鎌使い,有了田地补助的话，就更容易把额外收获的小麦再播种并加以利用。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 grain. In the field phase of each harvest, you can harvest 1 additional grain from each of your grain fields.","效果：打出时得1麦，收获阶段每个麦田可以额外收获一麦
强度：几乎没有实用性，不产生额外价值，可以看作是1麦的2分卡
难度：1/5
用法：如果早期用农巡套做麦田的话，可以用来提高麦田的迭代效率。或者R13/14补一个麦子，又或者打职业套顺手得1麦。配合：职业套，农巡套",,
A114,季节工,Seasonal Worker,T2,A,,季節労働者,在厨房也好在窑也好都能吃。中盘以后想要能把拿到的种子播下去。没有种子系连招或日雇连招的话，力量会有点不足。,"Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you get 1 additional grain. From round 6 on, you can choose to get 1 vegetable instead.","效果：踩零工给1麦，第六回合起可以选择一菜代替一麦
强度：理论上有10饭强度，因为3麦2菜是播种必需品，但是往往有别的种子获取手段，且犁5田才能播下去，所以往往到不了5分强度
难度：1/5
用法：R1/2出强化弱动，拿烤炉。或者第三四季出 踩四五次一播种搭配：其他零工套，犁田卡，胡萝卜D079不搭：2田流","Seasonal Worker This guy would be worth playing even without the vegetable clause. As is, he's
simply amazing. He generates a ton of food early as you get your grain engine
set up, and then gives you early veggies (plus more food!) in stage 2. This is
a pet favorite of many people at BGG, and with good reason.",
A116,伐木工,Wood Cutter,T2,,,木こり,如果首手打出的话，大概能产出8木左右。有像各种犁系那样、能用木来进行手牌压缩的卡就更好了。,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you get 1 additional wood.","效果：踩木头积累行动格 多拿1木
强度：有伐木的话 一局一般踩6次木头，可以说是接近长反馈6w，最大的缺点在于是张前期卡，一二回合打出最有效果。
难度：1/5
用法：注意一点，木头贬值了，因此绝大部分情况下不要拿2w，中期也不用太抢3w。四房早围是推荐节奏。搭配：木头推车 采莓 以及新卡林业研究 护林员等不搭：旧卡娴熟翻修，冥顽之人，新卡线人等变木头卡 会让木头更加贬值，使得伐木工触发次数减少
变体：伐木木推，要想办法舒适地打出三职业，第二季抢生时打出木推这张卡已被下调为T3",,
A119,捡木人,Firewood Collector,T3,,,薪集め,序盘想抢小麦田时打出来的话，即使只打一阶段也能出3~4木。,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"", ""Grain Seeds"", Grain Utilization"", or ""Cultivation"" action space, at the end of that turn, you get 1 wood.","效果：每当你使用了小麦种子、犁田、播烤、犁播行动格后，行动结束后你获得1w。
强度：全局基本要求4田1播1麦，这样就有6木了，短反馈4-8木的收益。但是种子卡、犁田卡、播种卡都会削弱他。
难度：2/5
用法：开始发展农业前打出即可，基本上走先农后牧的套路，畜牧的发展会受限制。搭配：早期麦子扩生套不搭：减轻农业行动数量的卡，要求早围的卡
变体：早期麦子扩生套，比如捡木人+干草叉+茅草+卧室，可以踩3田1麦1播，得5木，然后干草叉茅草卧室生娃。农巡、新卡麦田里的床等也可以配合。",,
A120,粘土小屋建造者,Clay Hut Builder,T3,C,,レンガ大工,如果没有改筑补助，把掉下来的砖用于增筑往往会有点拖沓。要是也能准备好除增筑以外的用法就更好了。,"Once you no longer live in a wooden house, place 2 clay on each of the next 5 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the clay.","效果：一旦你不住在木屋，往之后五个回合各摆2c，每回合开始获得
强度：开局多的玩家都知道，粘土会在四五季进行一次贬值，贬值前只比木头廉价一点点，贬值后基本相当于半个木头的价值。但这个贬值的关键变化点在哪里呢？在于大多数玩家不再发愁翻砖屋和炉子。也就是说，同样多的砖，砖在早期来买炉子和翻修是更高效的，砖用来扩屋和打砖工是更低效的。因此，粘土小屋建造者给的10c中，基本都是低效的，粘土小屋建造者总收益大概5分+。
难度：3/5
用法：用法在于早翻石屋，这样子你可以早出砖工或者炉子，把低效砖变成高效砖。
变体：粘土小屋建造者也可以成为石屋套的一员，也可以成为砖扩套的一员。","Clay Hut Builder Awkward since it encourages an early renovation. Because renovations are worth
nothing but VPs, you prefer to renovate later in the game. Still, it's hard to
deny the card's power. The 10 clay this gives you is enough to build two clay
rooms all on its own, making the occ often worth it.",
A123,架梁工,Frame Builder,T3,E,,梁打ち,只要用2木代替砖改筑与石改筑份的2砖2石，也能达到及格的效果。在砖很重的局里尤其亮眼。,"Each time you build a room/renovate, but only once per room/action, you can replace exactly 2 clay or 2 stone with 1 wood.","效果：翻修和造每间房子时，可以用1w代替2c或者2s。
强度：可以当做低配砌砖工用，也可以直接扩石屋，更可以翻修时省2c2s，灵活用。如果只是翻修时用，价值差不多短反馈2分。
难度：3/5
用法：主要是配合支柱、木匠、泥土修补、黏土小屋建造、共济会等砖扩，石扩卡。偶尔也可以翻修时用到，在卷砖、卷石、木头富裕的局有着不亏的价值。","Frame Builder Clearly you need to be building clay and/or stone rooms to make this Occupation
worth it. Building any non-wood rooms is usually a bad idea, and this doesn't
help matters enough to make me change my mind. This is really just another bad

actually good deal, but you have to jump through an extremely impractical hoop
to use it.",
A125,神父,Priest,T4,,,聖職者,与其他卡牌组合。不管是砖块扩建还是石屋连招都行。,"When you play this card, if you live in a clay house with exactly 2 rooms, you immediately get 3 clay, 2 reed, and 2 stone.","效果：打出次卡时，如果你住在2砖屋，立即获得3c+2r+2s。
强度：2屋流和砖扩的中流砥柱卡，代价是末生。强度可以到5.5-7之间。
难度：4/5
用法：你能早生就老老实实扩一间木屋再翻扩砖屋也不迟，如果不能生再考虑翻修打这张。比如说5生局上家抢先了，你就老老实实扩间木屋，5翻局或者有早翻卡再打这张。",,
A133,吹牛大王,Braggart,T0,B,,ほら吹き,最强的奖励分卡。不要过于沉迷于出进步，至少要以达到最低限度的村长盘面为目标，这样分数会更稳定。,"During the scoring, you get 2/3/4/5/7/9 bonus points for having at least 5/6/7/8/9/10 improvements in front of you.","效果：游戏结束时面前有6/7/8/9/10张发展卡时，获得1/3/5/7/9分 。
强度：5-9分
难度：4/5
用法：这张卡虽然强，但是打出上限还是比较难的（注意，这里的上限指的是这局游戏获得的分数，而不是通过这张卡获得的分数）。轮抽时多拿一些便宜次发，或者是便于抢主发的卡。这张卡由于要打2-4张主发，打满次发，因此缺动，需要有高效补分手段。因此，千万不要拿强化弱动的组合，因为你动本来就少，比如钓鱼套、零工套等。搭配：瓦匠B095，蓝图C027，商人C096，切石A143，锯木厂，垃圾房，贫农D132等。
变体：这张卡推荐早翻，因为你踩发展卡格子打主发效率太低，但是晚翻的话，就没有什么好用的主发了，因此不太建议5房，三四房时提前准备砖头和石头，就要做翻修打炉/井的考虑了。一般三张主发，拿炉子、井、第二个炉子或工坊，是比较理想的。","Braggart 9 points? NINE POINTS! This card can easily win you the game by itself, and is the most common way
I've seen players score higher than 60 points. Harnessing the Occ's power is no
cakewalk, but when correctly played with the right combination of cards, this
is pretty much unstoppable. I admit my rating scale breaks down a bit here - if you only look at the
percentage of time he is playable, he is probably a three star card. However, I
give the extra star simply because of his raw power - he's engineered more flat
out blowouts and unreal comebacks than any other card I can think of. The card is also easily a 5 star card in draft, where you can tailor your hand
to include many cheap improvements.",
A138,鱼叉猎手,Harpooner,T1,,,もり打ち,木材会稍微容易不足，但作为优先增员玩法的食物基础非常优秀。要有意识地获取篮筐制作。捕鱼的连招也很多。,"Each time you use the ""Fishing"" accumulation space you can also pay 1 wood to get 1 food for each person you have, and 1 reed","效果：踩钓鱼行动格时可以1木换1芦苇+n饭，n=当前家庭人数
强度：考虑第三季三人口时打出，每两回合用一次，用四次，平均4人口的话，花4木换4芦苇16饭。后期木头换芦苇略亏，但是可以忽略不计，因为鱼叉猎手基本上可以控到芦苇工坊。考虑是末动踩2食物钓鱼，一共获得16+24=24饭，正常情况下末动可以拿到4饭，也就是超额收益8饭。考虑到第一次钓鱼时可以拿到4饭钓鱼，那么超额收益至少是10饭。至少有着5分的收益。此外，钓鱼牌在轮抽时容易抓到配合，鱼叉猎手作为旧卡钓鱼牌中唯一稳赚的卡，一抓二抓拿到可以期望自己拿到好几张钓鱼组合，毕竟别的钓鱼卡没人要。
难度：2/5
用法：如上，第三四季至少三人口时打出。或者没有别的前期职业在第一季打出赚芦苇。搭配：独木舟，水上工人D144等钓鱼卡，套索、蓝图C027等用芦苇卡，而且要人口多才强，适合抢生卡比如木斧小屋，鸟巢不搭：任何需求木头量打的卡，任何产食物多的卡（要保证资源均衡）典型的是造纸人B109。由于是强化弱动，跟零工套很不搭配，也和早翻修的套不搭配，因为生的慢
变体：第一季打出时，要注意不要过早踩钓鱼，三到四饭去踩比较理想，而且尽早拿石头控到芦苇工坊，不然芦苇会飞速贬值，平时多拿木头",,
A143,切石工,Stonecutter,T2,C,,石切り,普通使用的话，改建和大进也就最多减免3个左右。有家具工匠小屋等强力的石料成本小进步的话，优先度会提高。和建筑设计图非常搭配。,"Every improvement, room, and renovation costs you 1 stone less.","效果：造房子 发展卡 翻修省1s

变体：切石蓝图C027，前三季打出，搬空工坊，要注意控制好木砖卢的数量","Stone Cutter Worth it if you plan on buying a clay oven, since this guy can save you a full
action in that case. He can also be a good play if you have some random 1 stone

A147,牲畜交易官,Animal Dealer,T3,B,,家畜追い,与调理场配套运用比较稳妥，但也可以在没有调理场的情况下于后期打出，干脆当作繁殖用来启动，效果也还不错。可选择是在拿家畜之前先启动效果（不能在0食料的状态下先把家畜烤了再支付食料）,"Each time you use the ""Sheep Market"", ""Pig Market"", ""or ""Cattle Market"" accumulation space, you can buy 1 additional animal of the respective type for 1 food.","效果：每次踩动物积累格前，可以花1f买一个相应动物。
强度：除非食物极度充裕，否则这张卡拿到2个以上的动物一般是烤了吃。一般有壁炉用得起，踩一次牛赚3f，踩一次猪赚2f，一次羊赚1f的，各踩一次就有短反馈6f了，适合多踩动物的流派。
难度：2/5
用法：注意事项就是踩之前要有食物，不能拿了动物再烤了再买。搭配：套索，宠物爱好者
变体：套索+牲畜交易官，跟抢似的。。第一动不拿动物就得被他抢光","Animal Dealer If you choose to just eat the extra animals immediately, this is going to be a
6 food play if you only take every animal once - almost worth it, but not quite
given that the food is given over time. However, this guy is much stronger than that. He lets you be the first person
to get 2 of an animal, which is especially important if an animal card comes up
the turn before a harvest. He also allows you to spam the animal spots for
food, denying other players from getting the animals they need. Superb.",
A155,杂耍艺人,Conjurer,T3,C,,奇術師,如果没有其他小麦补助的话，单体也不算差。,"Each time you use the ""traveling Players"" accumulation space, you get an additional 1 wood and 1 grain.","效果：卖艺时可以额外获得1木1麦
强度：不贪的话收益可观，常驻卖艺的话，第一季3f吃卖艺，第二季4f吃卖艺，然后再吃两次卖艺，一共吃4次，虽然损失了2-4饭左右，但是获得了4木4麦，单卡价值6-7分的下限收益。缺点是前期打出和要有规划，毕竟要在特定的回合踩卖艺，但凡损失了一次卖艺被人踩了，就是少了2分左右的收益，
难度：4/5
用法：新手推荐在R3/4，R7，R10/11，R13/14踩，老手可以R3/4、R8/9，R13/14踩。关键点在于判断场上食物的充裕程度。与一般人对战还要考虑心理因素，一般玩家往往会在收获回合优先解决吃饭问题，因此可以在非吃饭回合用末动去踩卖艺，错峰田忌赛马，用劣动取得优势。搭配：新卡卖艺套不搭：琵琶演奏A160，木偶等哄骗别人卖艺套","Conjurer This is obviously worse than the seasonal worker, but not much more so. Playing
it turn 1 and then taking TP on rounds 2 and 4 is an ok way to get a grain
engine started.",
A160,琵琶演奏家,Lutenist,T3,,,リュート奏者,如果在选秀时看起来会有小剧场Combo的话，就把它加入选项中,"Each time another player uses the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you get 1 food and 1 wood. Immediately after, you can buy exactly 1 vegetable for 2 food.","效果：每次其他玩家卖艺时，你获得1木+1饭，并且可以用2饭买一菜
强度：和木偶艺人一致，全局大致3-4次卖艺，一共3w3f，并且买菜相当于1收益，相当于长反馈5.5+收益。
难度：2/5
用法：和木偶类似，R3/4打出，并且要注意踩住第一季的钓鱼。注意不要抓太多前期卡。",,
A165,喂猪人,Pig Breeder,T3,E,,猪飼い,大致是2猪的效果。也有在最终回合没有猪时打出的手段,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wild boar. Your wild boar breed at the end of round 12 (if there is room for the new wild boar).","效果：打出时立即获得1猪，你的猪可以在12回合结束时生育（仍然需要父母和饲养空间，且这不是繁殖行动）
强度：分类讨论，如果你打出这张卡不拿猪，你只能获得1猪，超短反馈2收益。如果你打出这张卡拿了1-2猪，你获得了2额外猪，但是此时猪对你已经贬值了，2猪要么作为1分，要么作为6饭，顶多是短反馈3收益。
难度：2/5
用法：提前想好要不要12回合繁殖猪，不要想繁殖所以11回合打出，但是没繁殖成功，这样白白亏了，不如14回合打出。轮抽时拿了主要是作为2分卡，用来补猪。","Pig Breeder 1 boar? What are you going to do with one boar? This is basically the same card
as the Cattle Breeder, except early boar are much less impressive than early

B002,迷你圈地,Mini Pasture,T2,,,小牧場,前期就能打出并确保繁殖空间这点很开心。可以的话想在厨房里吃下去。,"Immediately fence a farmyard space, without paying wood for the fences. (If you already have pastures, the new one must be adjacent to an existing one.)","费用：2f
效果：传递卡，立即免费围一个11 的圈地
强度：4 木+卡，因为早围可以拿一点动物，因 此大概有4-5 分左右，强T2 卡，净收益3-4分
难度：1/5
用法：晚点打出，这么好用的卡别便宜下家 乐，唯一的缺点就是传递卡 搭配：早围卡，如矿物饲料，首锅流",,
B008,市场摊位,Market Stall,T3,,,露店,在小麦补助很多却没有蔬菜补助的场合用吧。即使在序盘想要蔬菜的场合，把小麦→SP来获得蔬菜效率也很差。,"You immediately get 1 vegetable. (Effectively, you are exchanging 1 grain for 1 vegetable).","费用：1 麦
效果：传递卡，1 菜
强度：在农业的价值模型中，播种前麦菜都接 近2 分，播种后的麦价值0.5 分，菜价值1 分。这张卡收益最大的方法无疑是把播种后的 麦子，转化为播种前的菜，可以达到1.5 分的收 益。但是大多数情况下，这张卡的收益只能到 0.5-1 分左右。
难度：2/5
用法：根据我们刚刚的分析，这张卡最实用的 场景在于第一季早麦田流，中期扩生麦换菜， 第四季播麦菜，第六季犁播2 菜让农业满分， 需要强大的犁田系统。大部分情况下，做不到 上述这样的高收益，只能够麦换菜补2 分。 搭配：先农后牧流",,

效果：为一个家庭成员提供居住空间
强度：强T0，基本上不会考虑把这张卡传给下家，不然被抢1生自己坐牢。在4人局不开额外空位中，生是要排队的，试想这样一个场景，你上家首个扩了房子，你第二个扩了房子，其他两人都没扩房子，那么理论上来讲，你可以美滋滋地不用抢先也能第二个生。假如R6开出来生，你上家一动生，你去拿了6木，然后你下家一个抢先篷车，之后呢R7你下家生，R8你对家生，R9你上家生，你变成了R10生，你因为一张卡被三个人插队，少了三个前期的关键动，这是恐怖的。前期的每个关键动，都至少远超2分，根据价值估算有4分的水平，相当于被打掉10分左右。那么篷车给打出这张卡的玩家提供了什么呢？首先他省去了你踩第一次农场扩建，你可以用这个动作去踩4f，而你丧失了一次次发的机会成本，相当于失去了2f，这样看来，你是用3w1f造了个房子。相当于花1f省下了2w2r，在第一季的一动半，大概相当于6分，并且，你还可以稳稳地提前1-3名生，这样看来，这张卡提供的总价值，在八到十几分之间。
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡不着急，便于你打前期配合，也便于你打2-3屋流，最愚蠢的打发是R4抢先打篷车，如果R5不出生就寄了。你前期安心发育，攒些资源和食物就行，等第二季R5-7抢先生，或者也可以先扩一间，等第四季抢先生第二个。搭配：2屋流 3屋翻修流不搭：扩屋流

效果：木屋的造价改为2w2r。
强度：最强木扩卡，这张卡又叫做斧头或者木 斧，1w1s换6w分，并且是早期6w，便于早扩 生，纸面价值4+分，考虑到早期的3w大概有 4 分，实际的净价值可能更接近6 分。
难度：3/5
用法：前三回合尽量拿到rsf，然后R2-4 均可 以抢先打木斧，尽早拿到首扩，前中期多拿rsf 和2r，尽早扩到4/5 屋，生第二个娃。由于生 的快，中期尽早解决食物引擎， 搭配：解决芦苇问题的森林审查员、拾柴等， 解决食物问题的懒汉，三齿鱼叉等。",,
B016,采矿锤,Mining Hammer,T2,,,解体ハンマー,1木变成1饭2分，若再结合繁殖或厩相关卡牌就更强力。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 food. Each time you renovate, you can also build a stable without paying wood.","费用：1w
效果：1f，每次翻修时免费造1 马厩
强度：1w换1f 小亏，2 马厩是2+分，而且还 有一个前期饲养空间的收益，因此收益在3+左 右，简单强力。
难度：1/5
用法：打出时间可以晚一点，在翻修前打出就 行，但是如果饿的话或者没有别的卡要打或者 要养动物可以早打。2 马厩推荐贴着房子竖着 放，也就是第二列的第三行和第四行。 搭配：马厩流卡牌，百搭卡",,
B019,板犁,Moldboard Plow,T1,B,,突き鋤,还算不错的农田补助。农田补助较少、农田看起来会很拥挤的局面的话，中盘之前想至少发动一次效果。,"Place 2 field tiles on this card. Twice this game, when you use the ""Farmland"" action space, you can also plow 1 field from this card.","条件：1 职业 费用：2w
效果：这张卡放2 田，每次使用犁田时，可以 用至多两张这张卡上的田地犁1 田
强度：白得2 田，纸面收益2 分+农业价值，但 是没有摇摆步犁强势，也没有转犁灵活，属于 弱T1 卡。
难度：2/5
用法：与摇摆步犁一致，区别是可以在第五季 再拿一个犁播，如果不想拿，就早点第四季播 种，规划好，而且不同于大犁围4，这张卡基本 要围6，准备好13/15木。 搭配：提供木头、种子的卡","Moldboard Plow Moldboard Plow In my version, the card is apparently
miss-printed, allowing the player to plow an extra field once, not twice.
Depending on what your version is, this is either a must play improvement that
surpasses the Crooked Plow, or an underwhelming but sometimes serviceable play. As printed in my version, a lot of people
underrate this plow, which might have something to do with the fact that it has
'mold' in its name (ewww!). Still, think of it this way: if you value
plowing a field at one action and 2W at a little less than one action (3W for 1
action is usually the default), this is a good trade if you have nothing better
to do with your SP/FG. The lack of any prerequisites and somewhat useful effect
sometimes make it worth the effect. If you get two extra fields, the card becomes
fantastic, and better than the crooked plow. You're probably going to be
plowing twice during the game anyway, so at a bare minimum you are paying 2W
for 4 VPs.",
B024,套索,Lasso,T3,C,,投げ縄,在终盘拉上栅栏后，可以一口气把家畜都聚集起来。这张卡打出后可以立刻启动。,"You can place exactly two people immediately after one another if at least one of them uses the ""Sheep Market"", ""Pig Market"", or ""Cattle Market"" accumulation space.","费用：1r
效果：你可以连续放置两个家庭成员，只要其 中至少一个家庭成员放到“羊”，“猪”或 “牛”累积行动格
强度：套索对每个人平均压制0.5-2 分，大概1 分，每名玩家少一种动物，但是可以多拿1 菜，亏1 分。套索每次触发，可以理解为多拿1 个动物，收益大概0.5分，考虑触发R11-14四 次，是2 分，减去1 芦苇的1 分成本，收益大 概2 分。
难度：2/5
用法：需要建立人口优势，这张卡本质上是强 化弱动。中期要算好r的数量决定拿2r还是rsf 还是3r，防止少一个r或者s没法翻修还要多 拿一次，这种情况下套索的成本就是一动2 分 左右了。 搭配：木质乳清桶，牲畜交易官等强化动物行 动的格子","Lasso Lasso This card is almost unplayable in 2-p and 3-p. In
2-p animals are very easy to get, so they are seldom a premium spot. In 3-p,
reed is so scarce that often you can't spare even one without spending a full
additional action to acquire it. However, in 4-p and 5-p, when animals are much
scarcer per player, the animal spot is often a great spot. Moreover, reed is
easier to get. In these games, the Lasso is amazingly strong and arguably one
of the best improvements you could hope to draw.",

用法：基本没用，有鼓励打次发的卡或者产麦 子卡可以抓抓 搭配：陶瓷等麦子卡","Bread Paddle Bread Paddle Bake bread actions are always valuable, and it's
sometimes hard to maximize the efficiency of the Sow/Bake Bread action.

undeniably awkward; by the time you actually need that baking action, you
should be in at least the third stage. By then, most of your actually good

难度：3/5
用法：前期尽量拿到首锅首羊，第一次或第二 次扩建时拿到2 马厩，踩次羊养起来，然后生 娃打织布机开始织布，这要求你第一二季度多 拿木头，后期想要养6 或8 或9 羊，就要早 围。 搭配：黄油桶，挤奶棚，羊毛毯等羊卡 不搭：先农后牧卡","Loom Loom The Loom can give a nice amount of bonus food if

强度：吃供需关系的卡，砖越富集越强，石头 越稀少越强。举几个例子，比如有雕塑课程， 石头就会稀少，有切石等卡，石头就会富集， 石头开在R5 和R7 也有2s的差异。砖的话主 要是看有没有强力的送砖用砖卡牌和扩不扩砖 屋。平均来说，5c大概相当于3s。也就是这张 卡每次最大效率触发一次，可以赚1c，一次回 本，每多一次赚0.5 分。但是注意，这张卡收益 不太可能超过2 分，因为会让砖变稀缺，主要 是用来换前期石头偷主发或者翻早石屋。
难度：2/5
用法：一般轮抽时5-7 抓可以顺手拿，如果有 强力送砖卡或者需要早翻或者偷主发可以更高 优地拿 搭配：砖头背筐等送砖卡，横切木、线人等用 石头卡，铸钟、线人等要求砖少的卡",,
B084,橡子篮,Acorns Basket,T3,,,どんぐりいっぱいのカゴ,可以有效利用在终盘容易剩余的芦苇。,"Place 1 wild boar on each of the 2 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the wild boar.","条件：3 职业 费用：1r
效果：往之后两回合摆1 猪，每回合开始获得
强度：这张卡一般在游戏的三到五季节打出， 此时的r的价值大概在0.5-1.5 之间，差不多是 略低于1 分。摆的两个猪如果是首猪，可以到 2-5 收益，如果不是首猪也不烤了吃，只有1 分 的收益。但是这张卡越早打出，越需求饲养空 间，一般在R12 打出，然后吃到3 分是常见 的，这样算有2 分的价值。
难度：2/5
用法：轮抽时如果有中晚期芦苇手段用不出去 的，可以更倾向拿这张卡。如果先农后牧还没 有首猪手段的，也更倾向于拿这张卡。此外需 要R11-12 抢先的控超生流也不错。",,
B087,佃农,Cottager,T2,,,日雇い農夫,因为扩建和改建经常会很拥挤，所以即使单独用也还算不错。不能进行厩建和大进这点稍微有些缺点。,"Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you can also either build exactly 1 room or renovate your house. Either way, you have to pay the cost.","效果：踩临时工可以造1房或翻修
强度：造2房翻2次大概8饭，不能打主发和马厩是劣势，但是不卡建筑和翻修是优势。这里要介绍一个概念，第二季一动不拿6w拿起始的局可以称为卷局。卷局分为卷生和卷房。踩起始下回合生人，或者踩起始下回合建房子。遇上卷房局时，佃农就很厉害，还能抢生。净收益8饭+
难度：3/5
用法：一般的用法就是一动抢先，然后别人就没法卡你建房子，还可以得2饭。
变体：有时你明明可以去临时工建房或者翻修，你还可以去常规的建房和翻修，卡住竞争对手。",,
B089,马夫,Groom,T4,E,,馬主,单从分数来看，一个厩就相当于1分，所以并没有那么划算。和其他石屋combo搭配着用吧。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood. Once you live in a stone house, at the start of each round, you can build exactly 1 stable for 1 wood.","效果：打出时立即得1w，如果你住在石屋，每回合开始可以用1w换1马厩
强度：如果效果拉满，相当于3w换4马厩，收益主要在于提供了额外的饲养空间，以及用额外资源换到了4分的上限，不缺木头的话是4收益，缺木头的话是2收益左右。
难度：2/5
用法：石屋套一般在R11前打出这张卡 拉高上限，因为石屋套本来就缺上限，本来就只有2-4石屋，但是仍然是最弱石屋卡之一。","Groom Stone houses are extremely difficult to reach, and usually you can only get to
it by the last or the second to last turn. So you're going to have to bend over
backwards just to get your renovation early enough for this guy to actually do
anything. Once you're there, a free stable a turn is hardly gamebreaking.",
B091,耕种帮手,Assistant Tiller,T1,,,鋤手助手,前期为了播种也可以打出，后期看着拥挤的农田悠哉地耕作也不错。日雇い连携当然很强，但单体也足够强。,"Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you can also plow 1 field.","效果：踩零工时可以犁田
强度：此卡全局只要不是五六季出了都好，毕竟前期食物值钱，早田也方便播。每次末动犁田2饭，5次就是至少10饭五分的收益，有配合更强。旧卡最强零工。
难度：1/5
用法：饿的时候出，不饿的话第五季出。搭配：零工套，种子卡，需要早田的卡如草莓园不搭：犁田卡
变体：耕种帮手有些时候要踩犁播和犁田来限制主要竞争对手，此外如果有两张零工卡，尽量先打另一张。因为两张零工卡你全局肯定踩超过6次零工，6田就差不多了，但是资源是多多益善的。",,
B095,瓦匠,Master Bricklayer,T2,,,壁職人の親方,减轻效果很优秀，但相应地场上的石头会变轻，所以其他玩家也更容易拿到大进步这一点是缺点。面对会玩的玩家时，很多时候不会让你随心所欲地拿到大的进步。和大的进步系的combo或建筑设计图搭配时很强力。,"Each time you build a major improvement, reduce the stone cost by the number of rooms you have built onto you initial house.","效果：每有一间扩建的房屋 打每个主发少花费1石头
强度：假如你有4间房屋 打两个高费主发就是4收益了，如果有五间房屋打个井或者石烤，很容易达到5收益
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡推荐翻修前打出，然后翻修打主发抢井，再快速翻石屋再打一张主发，不要让别人发现你能抢主发。然后可以在最后一两回合再踩发展卡格子捡个工坊这种补分，打出上限。难点在于准备翻修材料，和有足够的动去抢主发，以及抢主发和拿其他分数的平衡。搭配：蓝图C027，商人C096，家具供应商D096不搭：灯笼屋C035等要求你多打次发的卡",,
B097,学者,Scholar,T2,D,,学者,如果既没有能顺利把家升级成石屋的卡，也没有在石屋后想打出的卡，就很难发挥作用。,"Once you live in a stone house, at the start of each round, you can play an occupation for an occupation cost of 1 food, or a minor improvement (by paying its cost).","效果：如果你住在石屋 每回合开始可以打一次发或花 1f 打一职业
强度：石屋流的鼻祖 恐怖的卡牌。如果你 R7 翻修到石屋 他会给你省下 7 动，上限有 10 余分，没别的好卡且一抓还看到了马夫 B089*御犁 A090*共济会 C123*这种小弟很值得抓
难度：4/5
用法：最大的难度在于何时翻修 几动翻修。第二三季你基本要翻修到石屋，而这个时候翻修是比较卷的，因为有人要砖扩，尤其是你见过支柱时，一定要一动翻修，可以 2/3/4 房翻石屋，如果不会玩最好三房翻修稳妥。
搭配：石屋套 管理员 A087* 佃农 B087* 家教 B099*灯笼屋 C035*等鼓励职业的卡 二房流比如小农 B118* 共济会 C123* 石匠 C087*
不搭：娴熟翻修 前期卡 用石头卡
变体：学者共济会，可以二房石屋吃到四五季，用共济会扩到 4/5，再生育。","Scholar The 'When you have a stone house' clause is always a huge barrier to entry. In
this case, by the time you get a stone house, you should have already played
most of the occupations you actually wanted to get out. However, particularly
in larger player games (where early stone renovation is both possible and
occasionally desirable), this can save you 2 or 3 actions, provided you have
some late game improvements/occupations that you'd like to play. In the rare
instances that you will be able to use him properly, he can seem overwhelmingly
powerful.",
B098,有机农,Organic Farmer,T3,D,,有機農業者,如果有4个畜舍的话，拿4分也完全足够能瞄准。若是通过家畜繁殖来拉高分数的情况下，用这张卡就会变得很难出分。,"During the scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each pasture containing at least 1 animal while having unused capacity for at least three more animals.","效果：你每个有着至少一个动物，且至少有三个空余空间的圈地，给你带来一分。
强度：这里再引入一个游戏意识，上限卡往往比下限卡更有用。下限卡往往指节省行动的卡，典型的是乞丐学徒，降低3分的得分上限，省掉很多行动。或者是给资源尤其是可计分资源的卡，比如给麦菜田动物的。而上限卡是帮你在计分表之外额外得分的卡，包括送分的卡，抢主要发展卡的卡等等。有机农本身如果建立马厩，可以拿到稳定的2-4分，但这2-4分提高的是上限，而不是资源，在终局竞争上可能比5木更有利，因为大家如果玩得好，都不缺围，那这样木头价值就贬值了，但是上限卡给的是实打实的分数，不会贬值。
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡有着两个内在矛盾，一是圈地完整度与马厩量的矛盾，因为木头就这么多，你很难造满15圈地和4马厩，就算你能造满，有时因为你没田往往要围八格，难以有效发挥有机农的4分。最优解是围6格，造4马厩，但是木头和田很难这么全拿到。另一个矛盾是动物数量和有机农得分的矛盾，如果你拿了动物的分数会降低有机农的分数，那么这些动物就不用拿了，因为有机农也会给你分，因此对局时可以降低拿动物的优先级，但也要各种动物都抓至少一次拿低保，如果按照上面说的围6造4马厩，或者有些养动物的卡（比如动物保护区），甚至还能养一两种动物。搭配：小麦饲养员，动物保护区等养动物卡，采矿锤，新卡皇家木头等马厩","Organic Farmer Is this hideous card subtle commentary on the futility of organic farming? This
requires you to spend lots of resources building the infrastructure for
animals, but to not actually use that infrastructure. Rather than playing him,
it's usually better to use the action to get more animals to fill your empty
pastures. Still, there are times when all you'll want (and get!) will be 2 points. In
crowded games, where animals are scarce, this can be an OK play if you meet the
requirements.",
B099,家庭教师,Tutor,T2,E,,家庭教師,如果还有其他想打出的职业，也不一定非得在初手打出。可以在增员后作为第3张职业打出，最终把职业全部打出来拿到4点也已经足够发挥作用。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each occupation played after this one.","效果：这张卡之后打出的职业得1分
强度：如果你本来就要打满职业 这张卡可以长反馈6分
难度：5/5
用法：打满职业对于节奏的影响是极大的，少了7动，你一定要不让这些影响到扩屋和其他分数，并且有两三张以上鼓励打职业的卡。搭配：鼓励打职业的卡如供应商D152书柜C068教育奖励D042不搭：强化弱动
变体：家教在什么时候出是很难的。我给的建议是不应该影响第二季打次发的节奏。次发在二三季抢生抢建时打是很赚的，那么那些鼓励打职业的次发你要提前准备好条件。比如书柜提前准备好1职业2木，书架提前准备好3职业1木，教育奖励提前准备好两张发展卡等。所以有书架要早打家教，其他不急。","Tutor This card requires you to play him early when actions matter the most, and then
does nothing until the very end of the game. That's not a recipe for a good
card. That said, he and the Perpetual Student are an amazing combo. Often, you will
be able to play out your entire hand of occupations, making him a 6 point play.
Nice!",
B102,顾问,Consultant,T3,,,女性顧問,想和羊繁殖系的卡组搭配使用。作为R14的得分行动也还不错。,"When you play this card in a 1-/2-/3-/4- player game, you immediately get 2 grain/3 clay/2 reed/2 sheep.","效果：在1/2/3/4+人局打出时，立即获得2麦/3c/2r/2羊。
强度：对于大部分资源，我们在稀缺时的价值往往大于富裕时的边际价值，所谓边际价值递减。拿食物举例，如果快要饿到，那么一个就接近3分，趋于稳定时是0.5分，富裕时甚至会跌到0分。羊也是这样，羊稀缺时一个2分，平稳时2个1分，富裕时一文不值。羊更复杂的一点在于可以转化为食物。也就是说，在羊稀缺，食物平稳时，顾问在第六季打出有3分，每往前一季节可以提高1分。食物越稀缺，顾问每往前一季提高的价值越多。
难度：2/5
用法：大部分情况下，这张卡不适合二到四季打出，因为你有这么早的饲养空间，直接拿场上动物就好。除非你有鸟巢这种必须打职业的卡。搭配：赌博交易，幼畜市场，警官",,
B104,牧羊人,Sheep Walker,T3,,,夢遊病者,与一次性很难大量入手的蔬菜系Combo组合在一起时最能发光发热。除终盘以外，想在维持繁殖体制的同时不断进行转换。获得羊之后，如果没有饲养那只羊的空间就无法转换。,"At any time, you can exchange 1 sheep for either 1 wild boar, 1 vegetable, or 1 stone.","效果：随时把农场中一羊换成1猪/菜/石
强度：体系卡，如果有充足的羊，收益是无限大的。2羊换2菜，1分换4分；2羊换2猪，1分换3分；2羊换2石头，1分换2分。这样看收益上限就有6分左右了。
难度：4/5
用法：第一次扩或者第二次扩时打至少2马厩，养羊。或者用牧羊杖、召羊人养羊。等四五季及时再获得一个饲养空间养猪。
变体：配合新卡挖掘铲，可以第二季末拿到3猪，然后每次踩木头都获得3饭以上，全局不饿。",,
B107,男仆,Manservant,T3,C,,召使,用于石匠连招吧。即使没有连招，通过尽早改建也能瞄准大约6饭，因此也可以作为饭补助手段来利用。,"Once you live in a stone house, place 3 food on each remaining round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.","效果：一旦你住在石屋，往之后的每回合摆3f，这些回合开始获得。
强度：石屋套的上限都很高，但是如果没有提前翻修卡，也就R8翻到石屋，最多收益6回合，18f，9分+的上限。
难度：3/5
用法：7生局是石屋套强势的局，为什么呢？因为石屋走早翻修才赚，也就是3房翻修。那样子如果5生，到R11就一共有7生，自己拿到1生，剩下每人2生太亏了。但如果是7生局，三个人都是1生，只有一个人2生，大家还需要抢生漏资源，石屋套就有了优势。拿了男仆也可以灵活应对，如果前期出生，就扩到4再翻石屋，如果前期不出，3房就得翻修","Manservant Due to the lack of relevant resources in 2-p and 3-p, it is usually very
difficult to renovate early enough to make the Manservant worth it. In 5-p and to a lesser extent 4-p, however, clay is abundant enough that
renovating to clay and then building rooms becomes a genuine option. From
there, acquiring the stone for the second renovation is not too much out of the
way. In that environment, the Manservant can be good and even game-breaking,
depending on just how early you can get him out.",
B108,炉火男孩,Oven Firing Boy,T4,,,かまど焚き,单体的话算是还不错的面包辅助。和手推车成套就会变得很夸张,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you get an additional ""Bake Bread"" action.","效果：踩木头积累行动格时可以烤面包
强度：这张面包卡必须要配合才能有强度，因为等你有麦田大量麦子时，你就不需要踩这个木头了，平时0收益，有配合时收益可以很高，每烤一次都是至少1收益。新扩时面包卡稀释，强度上涨。
难度：2/5
用法：先有麦田烤炉再打",,
B109,造纸人,Paper Maker,T2,,,紙すき,因为越用食料效率越高，所以职业尽量想留到最后再全部用完。,"Immediately before playing each occupation after this one, you can pay 1 wood total to get 1 food for each occupation you have in front of you.","效果：打出新职业前，可以用1w换nf，n等于已打出职业
强度：造纸人几乎总比供应商弱，只有确认走职业套时才更强，往往我们要第2-5个职业打他。假设第三个职业打他，1w换3f1w换4f1w换5f1w换6f。一共4w换18f。净收益可以达到5分左右。不像供应商再打3个其他职业就回本，造纸人至少要再打5个其他职业才有收益。而且上限也比不上供应商的12f，唯一的优势在于可以中后期打。
难度：4/5
用法：二到五季打出 要注意多拿木头，轮抽时最好有给木头的卡。搭配：私有森林等给木头卡
变体：家具匠C116 造纸，你总是可以踩2f出职业的格子。T2木偶艺人 C152
效果：别人踩卖艺时，可以给他一f，然后自己打一个职业
强度：理论上来说，三次触发3饭打3职业，相当于白送3动 有6分收益。但考虑到三饭给别人，而且自己不能踩卖艺，最高不超过5.5收益。而且有时只能打2职业，长反馈3.5收益，勉强回本。
难度：5/5
用法：这张卡是新手噩梦，往往出现7饭卖艺没人踩，甚至14f没人踩。有时你甚至用麦子换食物就为了白嫖打职业。或者因为花1f买了职业而踩临时工，或者因为扩屋卡迟迟不出则末生。我的建议是你要在轮抽时要观察，场上其他人的食物手段一定要少，自己的食物手段一定要多。如果你明明把陶瓷、鱼叉之类的放出去，或者烈酒放出去没回来时就要警惕，谨慎打木偶。木偶往往要R3/4打出，然后第一季踩2/3次rsf或者4饭钓鱼。尽量不要扣别的前期卡。搭配：中后期卡 食物卡 职业套不搭：家具匠C116 家具匠要求食物给系统 你给其他玩家拿不到木头",,
B114,无子嗣者,Childless,T1,,,子なし,如果以最快速度为目标，到了第4R开始时就能发动效果。能拿到蔬菜很优秀。故意延迟增员，找准空档切入带进步的增员也不坏。,"At the start of each round, if you have at least 3 rooms but only 2 people, you get 1 food and 1 crop of your choice (grain or vegetable)","效果：2人口 多房子时得1饭+1麦/菜
强度：恐怖的稳健卡，三回合打出后，五生也能得2饭+2动+首生，保底5分。一旦7生，你都不用抢先，捡6木就行，而且保底4饭+4动，10分收益。有这张卡基本50起步 不受生娃影响。

B118,小户农家,Small-scale Farmer,,,,小作人,如果能在首手打出的话，即使只是在第6R进行2间增筑也能产出5木。和移动住宅组合的话就是无可挑剔的强度。,"As long as you live in a house with exactly 2 rooms, at the start of each round, you get 1 wood.",,,
B121,地质学家,Geologist,T3,,,地質学者,单独使用的话，作为粘土辅助来说稍微有点不够。和釣鐘相性很好。,"Each time you use the ""Forest"" or ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you also get 1 clay. In games with 3 or more players, this also applies to the ""Clay Pit"".","效果：每当你踩森林（3w），芦苇滩（1r）积累行动格（3+人游戏时包含土坑（1c）积累行动格）时，可以获得1c。
强度：全局要拿6r左右，一般是踩2次芦苇滩，两次rsf。然后一般踩4-5次森林，踩1次土坑左右。基本上是长反馈8砖，大概长反馈5-6分的价值，如果有用砖手段或者没别的前期卡可以打这个。
难度：1/5

变体：地质铸钟要注意先打地质",,
B123,屋顶压载工,Roof Ballaster,T2,,,屋根砂利敷き,在终盘会突然变得可以改筑。如果在 Draft 里见到，即使不 Pick 也要记在心里，其他玩家会不会插进改筑争夺战。,"When you play this card, you can immediately pay 1 food to get 1 stone for each room you have.","效果：打出时花1f换ns，n等同于房间数量
强度：稳定翻石屋，后期补工坊甚至井的卡。四房时3.5分收益，五房时4.5分收益，总是不亏的。

B126,木匠,Carpenter,T3,D,,大工,有芦苇补助的话，就能轻松扩到5间房。也要把终盘增筑石屋的动作放在心上。,"Every new room only costs you 3 of the appropriate building resource and 2 reed (e.g. if you live in a wooden house, 3 wood and 2 reed).","效果：你扩木/砖/石屋时，每间花费 2r+3w/c/s。
强度：大部分情况下是扩木屋时用，全局长反馈6木，6收益。但是注意，扩到5往往不是一个好选择，会亏掉田和围的节奏，因此收益往往不到 5。
难度：2/5
用法：如果没有更好的扩屋卡可以抓，旧卡环境下几乎是最弱扩屋，但是扩屋卡都是好的。
搭配：共济会，砌砖工
变体：跟砌砖配合可以2r1c扩，跟共济会配合可以R12/13扩到5。","Carpenter If you build 3 rooms before renovating, he's worth 6 conditional wood - an OK
but not fantastic deal given that the wood is delivered over time and that
you're forced to use it on a specific thing. Given how rarely people actually
build 3 rooms in the first place (usually reed is too scarce), this won't come
up too often. If you only build two rooms, 4 wood for 1F1A is ok, I guess. However, the
4/3/2/1 wood occupations all give 4 wood the moment you play them, not just
when you build your 4th room (which, depending on how the game is going, might
take a while). Furthermore, the wood those occs give is no strings attached -
you're not required to use it to build rooms. In my experience all of the
4/3/2/1 occs are playable, but they're by no means must-plays. Since the
Carpenter is almost strictly worse if you're only building 2 rooms, he's
probably not worth it in that case. It's true that he can be used to reduce the cost of clay rooms and stone rooms
as well as Wooden Rooms. However, I think clay and stone rooms are mostly a
corner case - most rooms are wood, a few are clay, and almost none are stone
(the Well tends to be a much more efficient way to get points). Moreover, in
cases where you actually want to build clay rooms, clay is probably common enough
that 2 clay and 2 wood isn't much better than 4 wood.",
B136,房屋管理员,House Steward,T3,C,,執事,既然都出了，至少想做成5栋房子。,"If there are still 1/3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 1/2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with the most rooms gets 3 bonus points.","效果：还剩下9/6/3/1个完整回合时，获得4/3/2/1木。游戏结束时房屋最多的几个玩家获得3分。
强度：典型的4木+红利卡。但是这张卡这类卡中最不适合新手玩的。我见过一半的局，打这张卡的人都没有拿到房管的3分奖励。跟别人分摊奖励的局更是数不胜数。为什么呢？因为你拿木头是要扩木屋啊，但是扩木屋的人往往没有扩砖屋和石屋的人扩的房子多，你是扩得过学者共济会，还是扩得过砌砖支柱呢？而且很多人轮抽时看见房管的话，会拿建筑大师或者石匠，然后把房管放给下家让别人打。我们只能不评价他的红利效果。当成前期超短反馈4w用。

强度：一般是踩两次，得2菜，看起来是4分左右收益，但是你往往有更高效的得麦或菜手段，因此适用范围较小。

a bit from splitting you two ways - a part of you wants to use the early
veggies for food with a cooking hearth, while the grain he forces you to take

still great.",
B145,拾柴工,Brushwood Collector,T2,C,,柴結び,注意木材容易变重这一点。和家具工匠小屋或木匠combo起来很厉害。,"Each time you renovate or build a room, you can replace the required 1 or 2 reed with a total of 1 wood.","效果：翻修或扩建每间房屋时，可以用1w减免使用时的1/2r

is an excellent deal.",
B163,牧师,Pastor,T3,D,,牧師,只为了这张卡而推迟增筑有点微妙。如果推迟增筑还有其他想做的动作，那就可以作为选项。,"Once you are the only player to live in a house with only 2 rooms, you immediately get 3 wood, 2 clay, 1 reed, and 1 stone (only once).","效果：一旦你是场上唯一2房玩家，立即获得3w+2c+1r+1s。

难度：5/5
用法：如果你想正常扩木屋，而且下家第二季抢先，可以用这张卡止损，一下子扩2间木屋甚至三间。但是千万不要在对家甚至上家抢先时用这张卡，早生一两回合收益更大。如果你想翻扩砖屋，这张卡也适合你。最稳妥的玩法还是全程2木屋或者2石屋，这张卡打起来最不看别人脸色。搭配：支柱，木扩，2屋流","Pastor Like the Maid, the Pastor is a card that you have no business playing if you

B164,召羊人,Sheep Whisperer,T4,E,,羊使い,如果有织布机之类的羊系卡牌就还不错。和炉灶配套也能作为饭的辅助。,"Add 2, 5, 8, and 10 to the current round and place 1 sheep on each corresponding round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the sheep.","效果：在当前回合+2/5/8/10,各放 1 羊，回合开始获得。
强度：一般来说，可以看作 2 分+6 饭，长反馈接近 5分。但是有两个问题，一个是你要么早围，要么早锅，如果你有这些手段，可能踩地图上的羊都会有 4+个，不需要打这张卡影响前期节奏。
难度：3/5
用法：配合用羊卡如织布机等可以考虑","Sheep Whisperer The best part about this card is the picture, which shows a dude using a
megaphone to 'whisper' to his sheep. Priceless. Unfortunately, like the Boar Whisperer, he's a decidedly underwhelming card. By
the time most of the sheep actually come, you don't even care anymore. He
needed to give a breeding pair before the second harvest to be playable. You're
better off spending the action building up your farm so that you can be the
first person to get a breeding pair of sheep.",
B166,养牛妇,Cattle Feeder,T4,,,牛飼いの女,如果去小麦2次就能回本。有搾乳台的话，也可以单体从序盘开始用，顺便谋求牛繁殖的方法也有,"Each time you use the ""Grain Seeds"" action space, you can also buy 1 cattle for 1 food.","效果：踩麦子时可以花1f买1牛
强度：和菜贩类似，第五季的2牛可以繁殖成4分差，但是要花2饭。如果踩两次看起来是3收益，再踩一次可以接近4收益。如果有锅的话 收益会更大。
难度：2/5
用法：预留好食物 注意要先花钱再拿牛，这张卡只有在有牛的配合卡时较强，平时还不如生抢2牛。搭配：挤奶凳 新卡养牛贵族",,
C016,田园篱笆,Field Fences,T1,,,畑の柵,木材减免+可以省略可能会拥挤的栅栏行动，很强力。想用L字形4格田地来瞄准4木材减免。横向3格田地的3木材减免也不差。,"You can immediately take a ""Build Fences"" action, during which you do not have to pay wood for fences that you build next to field tiles.","费用：2f
效果：立即获得一次围栅栏行动，并且此次行 动每个田地边上的栅栏不用支付费用
强度：2f 换一动，并且省2-5 木，相当于 3-6 收益，很稳健的卡，还不怕卡围。
难度：3/5
用法：我这里说两种情况，剩下的读者自己思 考，有问题随时回复。这张卡限制了你的犁田 位置，比如说5 房 4 田6 围，总应该从中间一列开始往下犁，这样 犁田的好处是，如果你没有新田这张卡，你最 多省3 木，如果从右侧犁，你需要犁满4 格才 能省3 木，从中间犁可以后期补田。再比如说4 房5 田6 围，此时你有2 种选择，从右侧犁田 或者中间犁田，中间犁田的好处还是3 田就可 以省3 木，但是右侧犁田虽然3 田只能省2 木，但是5 田时可以省4 木，看你规划什么时 候围，各有利弊。 配合：犁田卡",,
C026,连枷,Flail,T3,C,,脱穀棒,如果是田地较轻的场地，就可以作为面包辅助而值得信赖,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 food. Each time you use the ""Farmland"" or ""Cultivation"" action space, you can also take a ""Bake Bread"" action.","费用：1w
效果：2f，每次踩犁田或者犁播行动格时，获得 一次烤面包行动
强度：这张卡与刚刚的面包托铲和打谷板不 同，他自己是有价值的，前期1f 接近1 分的价 值，而1 木只是略大于1 分的价值，这张卡本 身可以创造0.5 分的收益，因此轮抽时比打谷板 和面包托铲更适合抓。
难度：1/5
用法：没配合第二季扩生时打出","Flail Flail When you're following the baking route, there can
be times later on where all you want to do is bake bread. In those situations,
this card can increase your efficiency, as plowing is pretty much always a good
action, whereas sowing requires empty fields. Unfortunately, this card suffers from the same
problem that the Builder's Trowel has - since you had to spend a half action
and a wood playing it, it doesn't really save you an action. Moreover, often
extra bake bread actions are unnecessary even when you're baking. However, the value of the the card definitely goes
up as you increase the number of players in the game. In 4-p and 5-p, it's not
uncommon to get blocked from the sow/bake spot, and this can be a great way
around this problem.",
C041,农场仓库,Farm Store,T2,,,農産店,费用偏重，且发动效果也需要饭，但1饭换2资材是惊人的转换效率。要出的话想在Stage1内就出。由于序盘会变慢，先准备好诸如2户增筑之类的某种翻盘手段吧。,"After the feeding phase of each harvest, you can exchange exactly 1 food for 2 different building resources of your choice or 1 vegetable.","费用：2w+2c
效果：每季结束时，你可以用1f 换2 个不同的 建材，或者用1f 换1菜。
强度：一般我们会在四五六季买3 菜，然后在 第六季播种2 菜吃1 菜，也就是说终局有4 菜，花3 饭得3 饭。一般第一季打出会很大程 度影响节奏，因此我们用第二季打出来计算。 第二季花4 建材打出来，二三季花2 饭拿2 任 意建材，勉强回本。因此净收益只有变出来的4 菜，也就是不超过4-5 分。
难度：4/5
用法：两种打法，第一季打出或者第二季打 出，注意晚于第二季就不要打了，不然就亏本 了。第一季打出尽量不要扣2c打，要扣第2-4 回合的4c去打比较赚，然后注意第一季结束可 以是4w1r，R4 抢先打农仓，R5 正好扩。如果 是第二季打，提前攒好4c/6c以及木头，排队生 打。 搭配：蓝图 不搭：高费前期卡，如木头推车，链式犁 EthanHuang: 补充搭配：农仓这张卡否定了一 些前期卡，因此他适合前期能快速回本的卡， 比如森林审查员，家具商；此外农仓有着给菜 的特点，适合蔬菜刨刀，胡萝卜",,
C065,谷仓,Granary,T3,D,,穀物倉庫,成本很高，但如果小麦补助不够的话也可以作为选项,"Place 1 grain each on the remaining spaces for rounds 8, 10, and 12. At the start of these rounds, you get the grain.","费用：3w或3c
效果：1 分，往没开始的第8,10,12 回合放1 麦，回合开始获得
强度：考虑3c换3 麦，相当于2-2.5 分换5 分，强度可观。本身又有1 分，相当于3.5 分 收益。如果用木头做谷仓，会亏掉1 分。如果 亏了一个麦子，又会亏了1 分，但是砖贬值可 能会便宜0.5 分。
难度：3/5
用法：扩生前拿一次3-6c，顺打谷仓。 搭配：农业流","Granary Granary This is prohibitively expensive for its effect.
Due to its low VP efficiency, grain is something best acquired early or not at
all. Unless you're playing some funky baking strategy that's light on grain
fields, you will probably always have something better to do in the early game
with your 3 wood/clay.",
C076,木头推车,Wood Cart,T2,D,,木材荷車,如果有管家或家具采购人等能提供2木以上的职业，就能一边出职业一边补足成本所需的木材，所以更容易行动。,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you get 2 additional wood.","条件：3 职业费用：3w
效果：每次踩木头累计行动格时，额外获得2w
强度：一般来讲，打出这张卡时，第一间房子与本卡无关，因此你还需要准备两个房子10木+围满15 木，每次拿3 木的话要拿4-5 次，如果要造马厩，会多1-2次，如果打木工坊，又会多1-2次，那么，每次踩木头都省2木，剩下两房子和围的每木价值1分，一共得到8-10价值。打出时的3w和3 职业时机比较早，付出了5+分，因此总价值是3-5 分。
难度：3/5
用法：多拿点前期职业最好给饭的，多拿点木头配合，供应商、伐木、采莓都比较好，新卡里森林研究、护树等卡不错。在R3-6 打出木推抢先是比较好的节奏，如果你下家首扩了，那你第二季很可能抢不了先，那你可以R3-4 抓紧抢先，早点打出木推。","Wood Cart Wood Cart This card is barely break even after you take wood
twice. With a three occ requirement, you often won't have time to take wood
much more than that. Still, if you can get it out fairly early, it can be a
decent long-term investment. The fact that it prevents you from being blocked
from wood (even a lowly 1W can become 3W) is a nice bonus.",
C079,石头推车,Stone Cart,T2,C,,石車,过于想着尽快出，反而导致增员变慢就本末倒置了。第7轮出，光是出4石也已经足够。有像执事之类能拿木的职业的话会更容易出,"Place 1 stone on each remaining even-numbered round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the stone.","条件：2 职业 费用：2w
效果：在之后的偶数回合放s，回合开始获得
强度：这张卡2 职业基本要R5 左右打出，R5 想要扩生正好打出比较难，因此2w算3 分的成 本，换来了6、8、10、12、14 的5s，前四个 s的价值接近1 分，第五个s几乎无价值，因此 在1 分收益左右，而且条件苛刻，现在看来不 应该在T2 水准，考虑下调到T3，实战中出这 张卡也较少。
难度：3/5
用法：主要要拿到首扩，不然R5 抢先是没意义 的，但是首扩且余下2 木对操作较为苛刻，因 此第一季尽量不要打卡。","Stone Cart Stone Cart You generally can't get two occs and 2 spare wood
too early, so often this will stay in your hand. However, in the games where
you can play it early, it will deliver a hefty amount of stone - sometimes two
actions worth. Stone is probably the best resource to have
delivered over time. Since it's primarily a late-game resource, you don't mind
waiting for it.",
C090,农田巡视者,Field Watchman,T1,A,,畑番,如果能有效利用小麦田，就从序盘开始启动；否则就从中后盘开始启动。1ステ4手可以造出2块小麦田。,"Each time you use the ""Grain Seeds"" action space, you can also plow 1 field.","效果：踩小麦种子行动格时可以犁一块田
强度：就算不考虑配合，也不考虑踩麦子比踩田容易，只考虑额外收益。拿5田是近乎必然的，相当于白得5麦，播种时分配3田种麦子，相当于白得11麦。麦子拿满分5分收益+3麦用于吃，可见至少有7分的水平。
难度：3/5
用法：毕竟是体系卡，难度不会低的。两种打法，第一季打或者第四季打。有麦子换分手段比如茅草卧室家酿啤酒烘焙之类的可以第一季打，播3麦田。第四季打就每回合最后一动踩麦子。搭配：茅草屋顶、卧室、家庭酿酒师、新卡一堆啤酒套装、烘焙师、栽培师不搭：任何犁田卡
变体：农巡茅草，第一季播三麦，其他动只拿木头，有条件的话打茅草抢第四回合先，没条件就抢第五回合先，然后慢慢扩到4房最好5房。第一季吃麦子，第二季想办法出砖烤。新卡环境下 啤酒套过多 农巡绝对有T0水准","Field Watchman Even relatively new players immediately understand how strong this card is. My
brother likes to joke that Field Watchman is a one-card combo, since plowing
and taking a grain are so obviously synergistic. This guy feels dirty every time I bring him out (the Field Watchman, not my
brother).",
C096,商人,Merchant,T4,E,,販売人,如果有很多想打出的进步，就放进选项。可以和小商人或建筑设计图等联动。即使用这张卡的效果打出食料箱，也只能拿到2饭。,"Immediately after each time you take a ""Major or Minor Improvement"" or ""Minor Improvement"" action, you can pay 1 food to take the action a second time.","效果：每次打出次发或主发行动时，你可以支付1f再使用一次。
强度：次发溢出或者需要抢主发的局可以使用，如瓦匠、吹牛这种主发卡，休闲木这种不抢先的卡，鸟巢针线这种不踩生次格子的卡。考虑到标准的次发有2-3饭的水平，每次多打次发的边际净得分在0.5，多打主发的净得分可以到1.5，但你要有足够的食物和建筑材料，考验规划水平，全局无配合可以到1.5-3得分。
难度：4/5
用法：算好这张牌可不可以让你前期速出次发拿到2动的收益，或者是可以省下你踩2-3次抢先的格子，那就是赚的。总体上没有新卡的任务型工匠、装备者等打次发的卡牌厉害。搭配：鼓励次发的主发的卡，如运木、杂物房不搭：其他帮忙次发的卡
变体：可以2/3砖+1f打壁炉","Merchant Unlike the Businessman and the Traveling Salesman, this doesn't have utility in
securing you an early fireplace. Instead, it gives you the same almost
irrelevant ability playing two minor improvements, which effectively reduces
the number of times you can take SP. This time, however, you have to pay food
just to do it! The only added utility that the Merchant has is being able to buy two Major
improvements at once. This is also an almost useless ability. If you have that
many resources lying around, you should be renovating!",
C098,骰子雕刻工,Cube Cutter,T4,,,サイコロ彫り,只要有一定程度的木头和食料，就有相当不错的得分效率。即使在最终回合打出，也会变成用2~3饭换1分的行动。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood. In the field phase of each harvest, you can use this card to exchange exactly 1 wood and 1 food for 1 bonus point.","效果：打出时获得1w，每个丰收阶段的收割阶段，可以用1w+1f换1分。
强度：这张卡净得分不超过2，在1-2之间，基本上不会使用到，只有职业流木头溢出的局可以拿1-2分。
难度：2/5
用法：前四季不要用这张卡，用效果就不如不用，食物木头都比较少，后期如果五六季送的木头用不上，也不缺食物，可以再打这张卡。",,
C108,懒汉,Layabout,T2,B,,居候,优先增员的话，在第2～3阶段会有相当大的发挥。注意，收获阶段发动的卡牌效果也将无法发动。,"When you play this card, you must skip the next harvest. (You also do not have to feed your family that harvest.)","效果：跳过下一个收获阶段
强度：这里不得不引入一个概念，从三齿鱼叉等卡牌可以分析出，第六季初的食物价值0.5分，每往前一季，食物价值提高0.05分。具体分析过程以后可能在攻略贴详细讨论。也就是说，如果我们用懒汉跳过第三季末的收获，将会有3.6左右的收益。如果用来跳过第五季末的收获，会有4以上的收益。但是第五季我们往往有动物和工坊，也一并跳过了。所以强度稳定在3.5-4左右。
难度：2/5
用法：生完一波孩子后用懒汉缓冲 解决食物危机，如果预计下一季要养动物，请这一季使用懒汉，省的浪费动物。搭配：扩屋套不搭：工坊套 早动物套 乞丐 新版卡牌收获套 比如树农 篮子搬运工","Layabout Clearly this is a card that you will usually want to play in round 13. In that
round, this can save you 9 food with no penalty if you don't have any relevant
animal reproductions. I don't need to tell you that that is a great deal. Another solid use is to use the card before the 1st or 2nd harvests. If you've
been aggressively pursuing FG (and you should be!), you often won't have
anything relevant to actually harvest, making the Occ all upside. In that
sense, the card can sort of work like a Mendicant that you have to play early -
this won't always be great, but sometimes can be very strong, especially if
your opponents are working to deny you food. This will always be a conditional card, but in certain cases can be extremely
powerful - even game-breaking. He gains in value if your opponents are strong
and paying attention to your farm; oftentimes, you can trick them into wasting
actions denying you food.",
D009,赌博交易,Game Trade,T3,,,獲物の交換,为了高效利用这张卡，先让羊繁殖后再用吧,"You immediately get 1 wild boar and 1 cattle. (effectively, you are exchanging 2 sheep for 1 wild boar and 1 cattle.)","费用：2 羊
效果：传递卡，1 猪1牛
强度：这张卡要想发挥出最大收益3 分，必须 只养羊，不养其他动物，这样子换出的牛猪才 是4 分，而且拿到的2羊必须繁殖一次才能换 猪牛，或者要拿到3 羊才行。
难度：2/5
用法：如果你在前五季有3 羊，可以直接用2 羊抢12 或13 回合的高价值先手，否则，你只 能等羊繁殖一次，再在第六季踩主发或者抢先 强化弱动为1 分换4 分动。 搭配：先农后牧，只养羊流",,
D015,砖造支柱,Clay Supports,T1,,,レンガの柱,单体使用的话，无论如何都会被改建翻到什么所左右，所以有点不好用。如果能在2R内准备好农田或家畜繁殖，就更容易把分数拉上去。第3间用木头、把第4~5间用砖增建也是个办法。,"Each time you build a clay room, you can pay 2 clay, 1 wood, and 1 reed instead of 5 clay and 2 reed.","费用：2w
效果：扩建砖屋的费用可改为1w+2c+1r。
强度：这张卡有两种打法，扩1 翻扩，或者是 直接翻扩，前者不影响生首娃，所以用前者计 算强度更为精确。在扩1 翻扩下，后期往往是 扩2 屋，那么你从10w4r变成了2w4c2r。我们 考虑这些资源中期的价值，前者大概15 分，后 者大概10 分，考虑到打出花费2w，总共省下 来3 分的收益。
难度：4/5
用法：没有配合的情况下推荐前期正常扩屋， 生一个再翻扩。有配合如砌砖工、尊贵之人、 翻修公司、佃农等卡，推荐快速翻修，然后攒 够资源、食物扩屋连生，用资源优势补贴晚生 的劣势。 搭配：砖屋流核心卡牌，搭配砖屋流小弟",,
D049,书架,Bookshelf,T2,D,,本棚,条件偏重，但只要启动2次也有6饭，不算差。还带1点也很优秀。像无心的学生那样，不支付费用出的话也能拿到3饭。,"Immediately before each time you play an occupation (even before paying the occupation cost), you get 3 food.","条件：3 职业 费用：1w
效果：1 分，每打出一张职业，得3f

难度：2/5
用法：尽早打出三职业，第2-4 季抢生打出书 架，然后打后期职业，主要轮抽时职业要前后 期平均 搭配：职业流","Bookshelf Bookshelf 1W for 1VP is an ok deal by itself, so this
doesn't need to give a huge benefit to be worth it. You won't always be in a
situation where you have played three occupations and plan on playing another,

with cards like the Educator or Perpetual Student.",
D115,草料种植工,Fodder Planter,T4,,,飼い葉の栽培人,即使在13R打出、仅靠两次收获就能启动也已经足够有效。收获后还能播种，所以园艺事务长更容易瞄准。,"In the breeding phase of each harvest, for each newborn animal you get, you can sow crops in exactly 1 field.","效果：繁殖阶段，你每只繁殖的动物让你在一个田上播种作物
强度：先牧后农的典型卡，第五季拿满动物的话，有着省2个关键动，略大于4分的价值，在特殊情况下，第四季或更早就可以开刷，那么强度可以达到5+。
难度：4/5
用法：先牧后农，既要你早栅栏早动物，又要你早田早种子。基本要有强力省动卡，或者强力的田，木头卡，不然都会是问题。此外，不卡翻修的卡也是适合这张的，因为这张卡要晚翻。",,
D118,冥顽之人,Bonehead,T2,,,唐変木,如果在中盘之前打出，虽然有时间延迟，但一手6木。,"When you play this card, immediately place 6 wood on it. Immediately after each time you play a card from your hand, including this one, you get 1 wood from this card.","效果：摆6木在此卡上，每从手中打出一张卡，可以从此卡获得1w，包括打出此卡

用法：一般来讲，应当在第一季打这张卡，因为第二季是抢先高峰，如果你有充足的打职业需要，那你可以更晚打这张卡。但是千万不要打完这张卡就疯狂抢先，落入陷阱。
变体：冥顽之人写字台D028，可以三到五季打出冥顽之人",,
D122,售土商,Clay Seller,T4,E,,粘土運搬人,只要有饭就有相当的效果，但无奈成本太重。为了饭补助和奖励分，还是想确保有制陶所。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 clay. At any time, but only once per round, you can buy 2 clay for 2 food.","效果：打出时立即获得2c，之后每回合限一次，用2f买2c。
强度：打出时的2c价值2分，前两次买2c的价值较高，每c一分，之后的c不值钱。因此正常情况下，4分卡。食物溢出的缺砖局更强。
难度：3/5
用法：有强力耗砖卡和强力食物引擎再打，如泥潭。早期可以抢个炉子，烤炉之类的。搭配：铸钟售土，前期可以每回合1f，后期食物溢出甚至是每回合用2f换1分。
变体：铸钟售土陶瓷+一张面包卡如炉火，每回合烤1c，钟1c","Clay Seller Another bad conversion Occ. Rather than take the 4 clay and convert it into 2
sheep, why don't you just take 2 sheep? This doesn't even have utility for
early cattle, as 4 clay is usually a highly contested spot in the early game.",
D138,宠物爱好者,Pet Lover,T1,,,動物好き,无论是炉灶烹饪场路线还是烤面包路线都能发挥作用。由于是强化小动作，所以基本上越是优先增员，就越能发挥威力。,"Each time you use an accumulation space providing exactly 1 animal, you can leave it on the space and get one from the general supply instead, as well as 3 food and 1 grain.","效果：拿一动物时可以补充一动物到原位，然后自己得1麦+三饭
强度：全局可以触发三次左右，得5分麦子满分+9饭，这样算有9.5分收益，但是考虑到如果没这张卡就不会踩一动物，因此净收益大概5-7分左右。
难度：2/5
用法：两种玩法，第一季出羊时出，可以踩1羊，解决前两季吃饭，建议早马厩养起来，不建议早炉子吃动物。或者第四五季围好了出，踩动物补分。搭配：牛奶罐，套索，马厩卡，早围卡，织布机，挤奶凳，牲畜交易官，牧牛人，新卡牧牛贵族等不搭：挤奶处（而且bga这里有bug，挤奶处+火炉+爱宠没法拿动物烤了吃）

D144,水上工人,Water Worker,T2,,,水辺の労働者,单独使用的话火力有点不足，所以和某种连招组合在一起用吧。在日雇、芦原、渔、回合4的行动格触发效果。在BGA上由于UI的关系，往往容易忘记也能在回合4的行动格触发。,"Each time after you use the ""Fishing"" accumulation space or one of the three orthogonally adjacent actions spaces, you get 1 additional reed.","效果：踩临时工 钓鱼 芦苇滩 R4回合版时可以获得1r

难度：1/5
用法：R1打出 踩临时工。之后积极去踩4饭钓鱼和2r芦苇滩。搭配：钓鱼套 零工套
变体：在与其他钓鱼套 零工套组合时，它往往是最先打出的，因为第一二季的芦苇很值钱",,
D158,锱铢必较者,Bean Counter,T4,,,マメな会計士,虽然是想尽早打出的卡，但既有时间延迟效果也很朴素,"Each time you use an action space on round spaces 1 to 8, place 1 food on this card. Each time this cards has 3 food on it, move the food to your supply.","效果：每次使用1-8行动格时放1f在此卡上，每满3f拿取到供应区
强度：我们可以分析下，第一季是栅栏 羊 主发 播种，基本上是每个踩一次，第二季是生娃 翻修 石头，加起来大概有4次，第三季的猪 菜和第四次的牛石，加起来有3次就不错了，也就是说，总共顶天了有11饭。而且是超长期的反馈，每次还会有延迟。
难度：3/5
用法：轮抽时基本不考虑这张卡，除非实在没什么前期卡了，而且又小饿时可以考虑，当作12饭卡用，其实比砌墙工、室内设计师更强，因为这个12饭给的更不亏。游戏过程中，基本上R5前打出来就不会漏饭。配合：新卡的踩主发的流派，宠物爱好者、栅栏护理员这些反复踩1-8回合的卡，职业套供给饭不搭：自动翻修、自动生娃、自动动物、白给石头的套路，减少了踩1-8回合，以及前期卡",,
D168,牲畜饲养员,Stockman,T3,D,,家畜の世話人,想和畜棚系卡牌搭配使用。第14回合从家畜0的状态下一口气能集齐3种。,"When you build your 2nd/3rd/4th stable, you immediately get 1 cattle/wild boar/sheep, even if built on the same turn (but not retroactively).","效果：一旦你建造第2/3/4马厩，立即获得1牛/猪/羊
强度：短反馈6分卡，但是条件苛刻，而且有马厩的话动物会贬值，所以大概是短反馈3-6分。

用法：打马厩前打出，一般是扩生完一次，拿到6w，准备扩第二次前打出。然后白嫖三只动物，之后晚围，围了后再拿一次2羊、2猪或2牛就行，养其中一种动物，这样子把牲畜饲养员价值发挥到4.5分左右。但是单这张卡不值得出马厩，要再来至少一张。搭配：马厩卡，尤其是泥耙，有机农

效果：传递卡，建造一个马厩
强度：如果你缺乏饲养空间，这张卡造的马厩 就是你本身必须要造的，相当于1w换2w，净 收益1 分左右。如果你不缺乏饲养空间，这张 卡只是增加了木头的平滑性，本身几乎不具备 收益。因此，这张卡强化了畜牧大户1 分。
难度：1/5
用法：预计养不下动物可以考虑要这张卡，本 身适用于最两种场景，一种是围611 这三个圈 地，强化其中的一个一格圈地，多养动物。一 种是围1111 四个圈地，强化一种一个圈地。但 是不太适用于围1122四个圈地，因为这种情况 下动物基本可以养的下。 搭配：农牧面积不平衡的流派，如8 围2 田 流，4 围6 田流。","Stable Stable One stable at half off is a pretty minor effect,

强度：本身1 分，每次播种可以有1 收益，每 次收割可以有0.5 收益，如果播种一次，很容易 吃到3 的总收益，是十分不错的百搭卡，但是 需要有额外的菜才会发挥作用
难度：1/5
用法：这张卡如果有麦子手段，没有菜手段， 可以早点出，手拿一菜或者用卡牌得一菜就开 播，第一次收割的菜不要转化为f，留给第五季 犁播种时种下去，后期看情况 搭配：先农后牧流，蔬菜流。","Lettuce Patch Lettuce Patch Compared to the Beanfield, the minor upgrade

worth the effort if you only have 1 or 2 good occupations in your hand (which
is often the case).",
C087,石匠,Mason,T2,C,,壁職人,4户→5户的情况下，因为能增加人数，改建优先度会提高。5户→6户的情况下是相当于3分的奖励分。因为算作增建，所以可以发动家具调达人。,"Place a stone room on this card. Once you have a stone house with at least 4 rooms, at any time, you can add that room without paying any building resources.","效果：如果你有4石屋 可以随时扩1屋
强度：卡面价值就有3分，而且提供一居住空间，可以不用抢超生，只用扣生次。不抢超生可能就能把犁田变成犁播，再加上次发的收益，总收益得有5分左右。
难度：3/5
用法：四屋并且第五季前尽早翻修是有难度的，但是石匠值得你围绕他这么打。
变体：石匠有着抢夺房管的能力，如果你在轮抽时看到房管，应该更积极地拿石匠，此时石匠至少有T1的抓位","Mason You'll usually play this guy at the end of the game for an extra 3 points.

C107,烘焙师,Baker,T3,B,,パン職人,稳定的烤面包辅助。和石窑一起用的话小麦容易不够，所以和レン窑成套使用比较稳妥。注意和手推台车不太契合这一点。,"When you play this card and at the start of each feeding phase, you can take a ""Bake Bread"" action.","效果：打出此卡时送一次烤面包行动，每次收获阶段喂养前，送一次烤面包行动。
强度：只要你有足量麦子+烤炉。每次烤面包相当于把价值 2f 的小麦强化为了 5f，收益是 2.5。就算第五季打出，也有 7.5 收益。如果前期打出收益爆炸。旧卡中面包流最强势的下限食物卡。
难度：2/5
用法：一般在播种好麦田后的下一季打烤炉烤一次，然后再打烘焙再烤两次。
配合：农巡，陶瓷
不搭：新卡小麦车虽然比陶瓷强势，但是不搭配烘焙；其他用麦子特别多的卡，比如大量的啤酒套，可能农巡都不够这么多麦子

Assuming you play him with an oven and two grain fields, you should never go
hungry. The strength of this Occ varies depending on the number of players in the game.
In a 2-p game, baking strategies are horrible. For one thing, there is no early
way to get stone. For another, there are so many animals in a 2er that you not
only want them for yourself, but want to prevent your opponent from having all
of them! In a 3-p, baking is still pretty bad due to the lack of early stone,
but often the Baker is powerful enough to merit playing him anyway. In 4-p and 5-p, baking is viable enough to make the Baker a strong incentive to
bake.",

强度：这张卡有后期打出和前期打出两种强度，如果是后期打出，拿到其他人2-5r，基本上是2分收益，不值得打出，除非有鼓励打职业的牌或者芦苇工坊。如果是前期打出，是要抓砖扩套，尤其是石屋套，如果抓住，就能早期获得2r，后期获得3-4r，收益可以达到4+分。

C153,样板工,Pattern Maker,T4,,,原型製作者,启动时机不稳定，但如果木材足够的话，得分效率并不差。,"Each time another player renovates, you can exchange exactly 2 wood for 1 grain, 1 food, and 1 bonus point.","效果：其他人翻修时可以花2w换1分+1麦+1f
强度：特殊情况下有用的后期卡，如果你缺乏麦子手段，又是先牧后农，每次都是2分换3.5分，木头不短缺的话，别人翻修3-6次就是3.5分，因为前两个麦子是2分，第三个麦子是1分，后三个麦子就只有0.5分了。如果你的木头溢出，大概2w只有1分的成本（按马厩换算），那么别人翻修3-6次就是6.5-9.5分。因此木头溢出局是有价值的，不像另一张T4卡骰子雕刻工。
难度：3/5

难度：4/5
用法：这张卡有两个主要的时机，一个是2-4 季的早围，这个时机主要要求你围得快。另一 个是R12 回合的剩1个空格留田，可以抢先雕 塑去犁田播种，还有R13 回合的无空格，可以 抢先去翻围或者超生。 搭配：大农庄等早围流",,

D077,环保砖,Recycled Brick,T2,,,再生レンガ,虽然能确保大量的砖，但石改建多半会在终盘进行，因此往往会为砖的用途而发愁。有像制陶场之类能用掉砖的手段就很优秀。,"Each time any player (including you) renovates to stone, you get 1 clay for each newly renovated room.","条件：3 职业 费用：1f

but this is definitely a niche ability. Veggies are worth 1 VP each, and
animals after your first one are always less than 1 VP. This means that a lot
of the time this is just not a good deal. There's also the awkwardness involved
with having plentiful veggies AND fences with animals in them (but not too many
animals!) - an uncommon situation to find yourself in, barring unusual
circumstances. The best use of this improvement is when an
occupation like the Undergardener has given you a ton of veggies. Since you're
probably going to easily max veggies, it can be nice to convert your excess
crops into some extra victory points. The card can also be a clunky way to get
a breeding pair of cattle - just take cattle at 1 and then trade in your veggie. Usually, this will have a marginal benefit, at
best. Still, it's hard to argue with the price-tag.",
D097,乞丐学徒,Begging Student,T0,,,無心する学生,只要在ステージ1出场就能把职业全都出完。选秀时要均衡地拿取从前期想出的卡到后期的得分系卡。若有几张前期想出的职业，可以在1ステージ也出除此之外的职业作为手段。书架或赞助人等职业系连携也〇。不过，家具工匠和交易教师无法连携。,"When you play this card, you must immediately take 1 begging marker.

强度：省5动至少10分，乞讨卡扣3分，省5饭至少2.5分，强度可以达到10分水准
难度：3/5
用法：轮抽时，要注意职业的平均分布，尽量不要拿太多前期职业，可以拿一些打职业得奖励的牌，但是注意和家具匠C116 没有配合，懒汉跳过的也是下一个收获阶段而不是当前的。另外，要拿一张终局职业比如荒野猎手，不然第六季的打卡就浪费了。如果有警官要扣一下，自己扣了不打，也不能让别人打了拉开三分。另外，这张卡和吹牛相反，送你更多的动，但是扣你分，需要有把动作换成分的能力和方法。搭配：荒野猎手C165，家教B099，灯笼屋C035，供应商D152，造纸人B109，教育奖励D042，书柜C068，书架，以及后期职业和鼓励打职业的卡等。不搭：警官，懒汉C108等。
变体：家教乞丐比较考验技术，两种玩法。要么第一季先家教后乞丐，要么第一季只打乞丐，用乞丐打家教。前者少一动多一分，但是所有职业都能提前一季节出，如果手上有关键的前期职业，比如木屋扩建工，可以考虑前期出。",,

强度：终局场上大概会平均留下4r5c6w，如果你有木工坊，6w对你来说就是2分2饭，有砖工坊的话，得2分，有芦苇工坊，得2分，因此，这张卡的强度上限是7分左右，平时大概2-5分。
用法：拿到1个工坊的话打出不亏不赚，2工坊就开始赚了，有可能拿到2工坊再在前五抓考虑，否则，这张卡只能在六抓或者7抓考虑。配合：切石，蓝图，商人，早翻修卡等抢工坊的套",,

D148,家政专员,Domestician Expert,T4,,,屋内飼育の専門家,和能活用羊的卡牌一起出吧。单独用的话效果有点不够。,You can keep 2 sheep on the border between each pair of orthogonally adjacent rooms.,"效果：你每对正交相对的房子之间可以养2羊
强度：本身无强度，提供了1种动物的饲养空间只有1分价值，但是考虑到羊是第一季就可以生的，价值比较难算，看你第几季拿到2羊吧。羊每生一只价值1分的食物分，因此第一季打出并控到羊，有着4-5分的生育分，假如说是堆积了4羊的首锅首羊，价值可能再往上提高2-3分，因为你打了家政专员别人可能就不想打锅了。
难度：4/5
用法：尽量不要把羊放到第二季，你抢生时会被偷，而且你要早点打，别让别人出了首锅，你们俩内卷，最好自己R1拿了2c。",,
C006,碎石清理,Stone Clearing,T3,,,石取り作業,在终盘巧妙穿插使用SP的话，可以打出石改筑的奇袭。缺点是通过种播不太容易拉开分数。,Immediately place 1 stone on each of your empty fields. Harvest them during the next field phase. These fields are considered planted until then.,"费用：1f

难度：4/5
用法：提前准备好石头和建筑资源，看好自己 什么资源溢出，可以先拿这个工坊喂饱饭。我 们需要优先打重要紧急的工坊，什么是重要的 呢？就是你溢出很多资源的，比如鱼叉猎手你 溢出芦苇，这就是重要的。什么是紧急的呢？ 就是别人也能建造的，比如别人手里攒着 2c2s，这样子你要早点拿砖工坊。 搭配：农场建筑，切石，垃圾房、家具商等主 发流卡牌；武装者、学者等打次发的卡牌，因 为减少了你打次发的需求，你才更有空在抢先 或者生次时打工坊；搬运工、树农、森林审查 员等给大量剩余建材需要工坊的卡。",,

效果：7 分，游戏结束时，你每拥有一张手上的 牌，扣除1 分
强度：我们这样分析，如果你在R1 打出灯笼， 你相当于放弃了2w，花1w去抢先，抢先带来 的收益大概是1f 也就是1 分，由于这张卡大多 数情况下不太适合在抢生时打出，因此我们必 须这样计算机会成本。用第一季初的3w换8 分，3w本身有4 分，因此是4 分价值。但是你 在后期必须打满职业，打光次发，因此这个4 分收益的限制还是很大的。如果你在第二季生 娃时打出，这张卡的价值会提高到接近6 分。
难度：5/5
用法：根据我们刚才的分析，这张卡有两个流 派，R1/2 打出，或者是第二季打出。如果你有 很急迫打出的卡如线人，那么推荐走前者。如 果你拿到的卡牌，如伐木工这种强度一般的前 期卡，我推荐你第二季再打灯笼。总的来说， 如果你的职业卡牌在第一季创造不了2 分的价 值，就请第二季再打灯笼。很多高分记录都是 第二季的灯笼打出的，轮抽时手上多拿后期职 业，便宜次发、传递卡。 搭配：很需要职业套卡牌，也需要一点点次发 套卡牌，手上多握点传递卡，后期卡 不搭：警官，限制大、高费用、使用场合少的 卡牌，过多的前期卡",,
C051,渔网,Fishing Net,T3,,,漁網,在序盘打出的话，大概能有3~4饭左右。也可能会帮到其他玩家的渔业combo。如果有渔业combo的玩家，因为自己和对方都能拿到更多饭，所以也有人认为是Win-Win。钓鱼师或港口商人等被打出后会变得不容易发挥作用。注意如果被别人打出，手牌里是0饭的状态就没法去捕鱼了。,"Each time another player uses the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, they must first pay you 1 food.

用法：有早菜手段的话，越早打出越好。搭配：早菜卡，如无子嗣，书柜，新卡虚弱之人。
变体：书柜烈酒，和烘焙陶瓷、铸钟运土、石屋男仆、2房大农，并列为旧卡5大吃饭组合。拿到任何一个组合就是全局不饿。",,
C112,打谷者,Thresher,T4,,,脱穀者,虽然需要食物，但田地相关能附带小麦很优秀。序盘做出小麦田的动向也〇,"Immediately before each time you use the ""Grain Utilization"", ""Farmland"", or ""Cultivation"" action space, you can buy 1 grain for 1 food.","效果：每次你使用 田、播烤、犁播行动格前，你可以花1f买1麦。
强度：低配农巡，仍然是前三麦是2，2，1收益，之后的麦子都是0.5收益。那就是说最多有1.5，1.5，0.5收益，3.5收益。但是考虑到出烤炉的消耗的边际麦子价值2.5，因此总收益大概是3.5-7.5。
难度：3/5
用法：其实是相对低效的麦子手段，没有别的麦子手段可以用，食物不缺的话是早麦田强卡。搭配：啤酒套，茅草套",,
C135,警官,Constable,T3,C,,村長,在 Draft 中如果看到有负分的卡被人 Pick 了，为了不让别人拿走，自己把这张卡拿走也是可以的。,"If there are still 1/3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 1/2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with no negative points gets 3 bonus points.","效果：获得4w 游戏结束时“没有任何扣分项”的玩家，就可以获得3分
强度：比房管稳健有力，可以制裁同局的乞丐 灯笼 啤酒池等强势卡牌。自己如果抓了这张牌，其他抓牌 基本都会保障自己不扣分，所以自己基本是稳吃这三 分的。超短反馈4w+潜在的3分差。 难度：3/5 用法：如果没有犁田手段 可以考虑早点拿木头围8/9 格牧场，早拿动物和种子，以及2田，早点稳定好各 项低保，别在 R14 被竞争对手卡住。 
变体：R14打警官逮捕竞争对手。","Constable If someone besides you gets the 5 VPs for having no negative points, you
probably would have lost to them anyway. This makes the VP ability pretty much
a neutral EV move, although it can be risky if your opponent has either the
Yeoman Farmer or the Hide Farmer.",
C147,牧牛人,Cowherd,T4,C,,牛の飼育士,只要能去一次就能稳拿牛繁殖，所以还不错。想和牛系卡搭配使用。,"Each time you use the ""Cattle Market"" accumulation space (introduced in round 10 or 11), you get 1 additional cattle.","效果：每次拿牛累计行动时多拿1牛
强度：牛在R10/11出的话，全局只有4-5次拿牛的机会，而一头牛的价值是0.5-2分，所以就算每回合踩牛，也只有2-10分的收益。但是考虑到，牛达到2分是壁炉烤了吃的成果，而烤壁炉的人基本不会每回合拿1牛，所以不现实。因此，这张卡的正确用法是第四季拿一次牛，用于生育，可以看作变出来2牛。然后第5-6季再拿1-2次。总共变出来3-4牛，可以到1.5分上限-8分下限。上限提升很小，而且是短反馈，除非很饿，基本不考虑。
难度：2/5
用法：R10或者R11打出，拿次牛养起来搭配：挤奶凳、牧牛贵族等牛积分卡","Cowherd If you play this, it should be with the intention of taking the '1 cow' space
every turn. Doing this will generate a huge amount of food and deny your
opponents cattle, at least until they realize what you're up to and begin to
aggressively take the spot at 1 cow. This can be very powerful, but relies a
lot on your opponents not just taking 1 cattle for the 2 VPs to deny you.",
C149,资源循环利用者,Resource Recycler,T3,,,資材再生業者,用于增建增员目的的话不太稳定，但因为2饭相当于2点，所以得分效率还算不错。有「こて」和「住居计划」等改筑辅助时，不仅更容易把自己变成石屋，改筑格也会变轻，因此很优秀。,"Each time another player renovates to stone, if you live in a clay house, you can pay 2 food to build a clay room at no additional cost.","效果：每当别人翻修到石屋时，如果你住在砖屋，可以花费2f而不用其他花销扩1间砖屋。
强度：砖屋是2收益+居住空间，而大家翻石屋基本是4-6季，那个时候你多了居住空间大概能在第五季生娃。一般是可以免费扩2间，总收益大概5+左右，但是等别人翻石屋往往就自己翻修不太了了，这是降低了上限。
难度：5/5
用法：这张卡适合7生出，7生的话，生娃要排队，咱们没必要跟他们卷，扩到3房翻修成砖就打了资源循环，别人翻石屋时第五季就能生娃了，然后有两家翻修石屋就可以扩到5就差不多了。7生局大家理性的话都会3-4屋，甚至有可能都翻修到石屋还给你留一个翻石屋的机会，所以要注意最后两回合顺位，别被人恶意卡翻修。搭配：房管，资源循环是房管强有力的竞争者",,
D042,教育奖励,Education Bonus,T1,,,教育手当,不必勉强去追求效率，只要发动第5张、第6张的效果就已经足够了,"After you play your 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th/6th occupation this game, you immediately get 1 grain/clay/reed/stone/vegetable/field (not retroactively).","条件：2 张发展卡 费用：1f
效果：当你打出你的第1/2/3/4/5/6 张职业时， 获得麦/砖/芦/石/菜/田。
强度：这张卡有两种打法，拿麦与不拿麦，一 般情况下，拿麦都会很影响节奏，默认不拿。 那么吃到芦/石/菜/田也是6 收益，净收益有 5.5。如果能吃到麦子，可以达到7 收益，这种 情况下类似于第二季灯笼，但是比灯笼的节奏 把控简单许多。
难度：3/5
用法：根据轮抽决定，一般来说如果有T1 及以 上的前期职业卡可以拿至多2 张，T2 及以下的 前期职业卡不要拿。如果最后所有卡都是后期 卡，那可以第二季打出这张卡，吃满收益。此 外，如果你别的卡能提供2 个以上麦子，也不 需要晚打这张卡，如果需要早点打这张卡，需 要多拿一些前期强势的次要发展卡，或者想办 法拿到首炉。 搭配：职业流",,
D075,木头地,Wood Field,T3,,,樹木畑,1饭1分的最低限作用。序盘如果瞄准小麦田的话，顺便播种也很优秀。游戏结束时在树木田上面的木材不会被家具制作所或士兵计数。,"You can plant wood on this card as though it were 2 fields, but it is considered 1 field. Sow and harvest wood on this card as you would grain.","条件：1 职业 费用：1f
效果：1 分，这张卡视为一个田地，但可以作为 两块田使用，只能播种木头，木头的播种与小 麦相同。
强度：大多数情况只能作为0.5 分补分卡
难度：1/5
用法：补分，除非你是第四季或更早播种的先 农后牧流，第五季播种的话要考虑影不影响第 五季围栅栏，以及能不能终局收割木头拿到收 益。",,
D078,芦苇池塘,Reed Pond,T2,B,,葦の池,为了第4~5间房以及改建用，也要有意识地考虑篮子制或芦苇条件的进步。,"Place 1 reed on each of the next 3 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the reed.","条件：3 职业
效果：接下来的3 回合各摆1r，回合开始获得

难度：2/5
用法：两种用法，早期职业多的流派快速打出 拿到3r扩2 屋，或者是先扩一间再打职业再打 这张卡扩到4、5 间或者给翻修用。 搭配：早职业流、扩2 流、4-5 屋流、早翻流 不搭：3 屋流","Reed Pond Reed Pond In 3-p, this card can engineer blowouts. While the
other players are scrambling for the reed, you can just play out occupations
and then this, avoiding the fight altogether. In other modes, playing this late
will sometimes save you a full action, as you won't have to make a reed grab
for renovation. While three occupations is a lot, this has a strong enough
effect to usually be worth prioritizing.",
D087,建筑大师,Master Builder,T3,D,,建築士,如果成为石匠则有3分奖励。也存在与豪华住宿所或仆役头的Combo。由于视为增筑，因此改筑准备或家具调达人效果会发动。,"Once your house has at least 5 rooms, at any time, but only once this game, you can add another room at no cost.","效果：如果你住在不少于5间屋子，你可以随时免费扩1间。
强度：低配石匠C087，超短反馈3收益，还压制了农牧发展，也就有房管B136时比较赚。
难度：1/5
用法：R13/14打出即可。","Master Builder If you can somehow get to 5 stone rooms, he'll be worth it as a 3 point play.
However, this is usually a pretty difficult task to accomplish, and three
points isn't enough of an incentive to actively try to get this guy out.",
D104,栽培师,Cultivator,T1,,,耕作者,想和某种犁系卡牌成套运用。,"For each new field tile you get, you also get 1 wood and 1 food.","效果：每获得1田，得1木1饭
强度：这里要引入一个概念，长反馈以及短反馈，像伐木工那种开局打出 全局生效的卡是长反馈，必须前期打出。这张卡是短反馈，四五季打出就行。还有的卡立即获得资源，可以称之为超短反馈。一般我们认为，如果收益和成本一致，超短反馈强于短反馈强于长反馈。栽培师的强度大概是短反馈5木5饭左右，有着7分左右稳定收益。
难度：1/5
用法：基本上是三四五季打出，然后末动犁田，早耕搭配：用田卡（如田园篱笆，大农庄，碎石清理）犁田卡（如各种犁）种子卡（如无子嗣）用种子卡（如胡萝卜D079）不搭：2田流卡（如牧羊杖，马槽）
变体：讲几个套路吧。首先是栽培大农，有栽培的话，大农可以R5出，这个之后分析大农细说。栽培大犁，摇摆步犁可以2动犁6田，这样子建议三到五季早犁，早拿到6木6饭，然后要想办法开马厩或者其他方法养动物，因为圈地的占地面积变小了。栽培除草铲茅草，可以用栽培手耕3田，拿一个麦子，播下去除草铲分成三个，再出茅草。",,
D119,木材贸易商,Wood Barterer,T2,,,森の労役者,因为既能产出木也能产出芦苇，所以木屋增建会变得相当容易。反复去“柵”的动作也很优秀。终盘还能从没有资材的状态下进行建造厩舍的1点行动。,"Each time before you use an action space with a ""Build Fences"" or ""Build Rooms"" action, you can choose to either get 2 wood or exchange up to 2 wood for 1 reed each.","效果：每次踩带有建造房屋和围栅栏的行动格前，获得2w或者用1/2w换1/2r
强度：很稳健的卡。这里要传输一个游戏意识：如果两张前期卡收益一致，往往是更利于扩屋的卡更强。因为，如果你不走2屋开局，你最迟也要在R5前攒够扩屋资源，来避免末生。这张卡打出是不影响扩屋的，而且全局稳定至少6木，经常达到8w，是一张稳定的长反馈6分卡。
难度：1/5
用法：不要被这张卡的表面蒙蔽，第一季的r比w更值得你去拿，因为你一旦w换了r，就损失一次2w，所以不用着急拿木头，多拿rsf或者2r吧，一次3w就够你扩屋的了，能扩早扩，尽量R3/4扩。搭配：栅栏套 马厩套不搭：佃农B087
变体：木贸+栅栏修理员A088，每踩一次修栅栏可以省5木，较为强势的早围组合。",,
D120,运土工,Clay Deliveryman,T2,C,,粘土調達人,1手8砖很优秀，但时间滞后很大。后半的砖容易变得没用，所以要确保有制陶所等用途。和铸钟师或清廉洁白的人很契合。,"Place 1 clay on each remaining space for rounds 6 to 14. At the start of these rounds, you get the clay.","效果：摆R6-14各一个c，在这些回合开始获得。
强度：9c就有长反馈4.5分了，况且早期的大量砖的价值不止0.5分，因为可以扣壁炉烤炉 早翻解决吃饭。大约有长反馈5分的价值，但是最后几个c容易浪费掉。
难度：2/5
用法：R4/5二动打出，注意砖工坊，基本上要在三四季翻修打主发建立优势搭配：铸钟工 D107
变体：铸钟运土，第一季打出，每回合得3饭，极强组合","Clay Deliveryman This guy has the most utility in 2-p, where clay can be very scarce. With more
players the card becomes more of a conditional play, since clay should already
be plentiful after round 6. If you play him, it should be with the intention of
using massive amounts of clay (clay rooms, pottery, etc.). This should
hopefully prevent clay from being too easy to get for your opponents.",
D152,供应商,Patron,T2,C,,パトロン,如果还有其他想出的职业，也可以从第2张以后再出也是个办法。想和职业系的combo配套运用。,"Immediately before each time you play an occupation after this one (even before paying the occupation cost), you get 2 food.","白嫖打职业。或者因为花1f买了职业而踩临时工，或

C011,野生保护区,Wildlife Reserve,T3,B,,動物園,增筑时要意识到：有这个和1厩的话就能进行1种繁殖。,"This card can hold up to 1 sheep, 1 wild boar, and 1 cattle.","条件：2 职业 费用：2w
效果：1 分，这张卡提供了1 羊、1 猪和1 牛的 饲养空间
强度：这张卡的模型较为复杂，这里需要说明 繁殖空间的概念，繁殖空间是指可以让一种动 物繁殖并不丢弃的3 个饲养空间。也就是说，2 马厩和房屋构成了一个繁殖空间。1 圈地和房屋 构成了一个繁殖空间。1 马厩、2 圈地、房屋构 成了两个繁殖空间。围6 格的1122 圈地，构成 了3 个繁殖空间。此卡本身不提供繁殖空间， 但是可以强化2 只的饲养空间为繁殖空间。举 个例子，这张卡+1 马厩+房屋，是一个繁殖空 间的。这张卡+2 马厩+1 圈地+房屋是两个繁殖 空间。如果不构成繁殖空间，这张卡的饲养空 间价值大概1 分，加上本身1 分，2w换2 分近 乎不亏不赚。但是如果我们利用了这张卡的繁 殖空间，就可以净赚一分。
难度：4/5
用法：规划好繁殖空间，争取恰好用到这张卡 用来繁殖。不繁殖的情况下，这张卡也可以作 为早期抓取动物的手段，特别适合警官局，畜 牧士局，保住三种动物。 搭配：警官，畜牧士","Wildlife Reserve Wildlife Reserve I love this card. It's a strict upgrade to an

to eventually do: get one of every animal.",
C014,茅草屋顶,Straw-Thatched Roof,T3,,,わら小屋,如果有“畑番”等小麦田辅助，从序盘开始就有值得瞄准的价值。打出后，相对而言会让其他玩家的芦苇压力变轻，这点令人纠结。终盘再打出，只是用来减轻改筑所需的芦苇也已经足够。,You no longer need reed to renovate or build a room.,"条件：3 麦田
效果：1 分，之后你建造房屋和翻修不再需要r
强度：保底1 分卡，在中后期作出可以省2r的 翻修费，一般算是能拿到2 收益。如果在第一 季作出3 麦田的话，可以省下8r的费用，是其 中前6r的价值极高，总收益可以到15+。如果 你要做12 石屋流，可以省下海量的r，收益很 容易到20+。
难度：4/5
用法：两种打法，第一季或第二季三麦田，或 者是中后期补分省翻修的芦苇。什么时候可以 走第一季三麦田呢？我们思考一下，如果我们 手拿3 麦，犁3 田去播种，需要7 动，但是如 果我们有农巡，只需要5 动。我们大致认为， 最多6 动作出3 麦田是划算的买卖。比如说打 谷者，需要5 动+1 次饭。或者是农田看护者， 需要踩3 砖+打职业+犁+犁+播，也是5 动。或 者是小麦售卖商，职业+踩麦+犁+犁+犁+播，6 动也可以接受。 搭配：卧室麦床啤酒等先农后牧卡、斧头、支 柱等省非芦苇的建筑资源卡 不搭：木扩等省芦苇卡",,
C037,丘陵宅院,Dwelling Mound,T4,,,人工丘の集落,作为缺点效果的替代是3分。耕3块田的话，就是4饭3分，得分效率还算不错。必须在1饭价值很大的序盘打出这一点稍微是个缺点，不过如果序盘没有想用SP打出的卡，那也完全是个选择。,"From now on, you must pay 1 food for each new field tile that you place in your farmyard.","条件：第三回合或之前 费用：1f

C104,收集者,Collector,T3,,,コレクター,用途多种多样，但稳妥的做法是先占调理场，一边吃家畜一边收集种子和资材。也要记住在11～14R先拉好栅栏后再起动2次拿到家畜套装的打法。,"This card is an action space for you only. When you use it for the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th time, you get 1 begging marker and 6/7/8/9 different good of your choice.","效果：这是仅你可用的行动格，当你第1/2/3/4次使用时，拿取一个乞讨标记，并获得6/7/8/9种资源各一个。（资源包括5种可计分资源：麦菜羊猪牛，4种建筑材料：木砖芦石，以及食物，一共10种）
强度：下限卡的巅峰，亏损了6分上限去争取下限。这张卡一般是用来踩两次的，然后动物生2-5次娃，种子播种下去。这样看来，农业可以得到9分的分差，畜牧可以得到10+分的分差，额外的建材和食物可以帮助翻修等。净收益9+分。但是损失了6分的上限。
难度：5/5
用法：早围，三房会舒服一点，最好三四季围出来，然后尽早踩两次让动物开始生。之后补耕地，有资源的话可以补一间房子顺带打马厩，没资源就早点翻修，最后播种或者耕作一次就行。",,
C106,土豆收割工,Potato Harvester,,,,じゃがいも収穫者,作为蔬菜系连招的搭配。即使什么都不做也能出3饭，因此也可以用在职业系连招中,"When you play this card, you immediately get 3 food. For each vegetable you get from your fields during the field phase of the harvest, you get 1 additional food.",,,
C110,家庭酿酒师,Home Brewer,T3,,,自家醸造師,作为吃饭补助和得分来源都很优秀。,"After the field phase of each harvest, you can use this card to turn exactly 1 grain into your choice of 3 food or 1 bonus point.","效果：每个收获阶段喂养前，可以把1麦换成3f或者1分。
强度：其实是比较弱的卡，当时评梯度有点问题，应该放到T4更合适。大部分情况下入不敷出，就算是第一季打出吃6季也顶多6收益，要求还严苛需要6麦子，除了农巡基本都出不起，三麦田茅草开局的话可以打一打。
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡是用来锦上添花的，本身不值得为了他考虑做麦田，如果你的其他卡让你早做麦田，那这张卡才值得在麦田收获后出。

C121,粘土揉捏工,Clay Kneader,T4,,,陶土こね,光是打出来也算是不错的资材量。和职业combo或小麦combo一起配套。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood and 2 clay. Each time after you use a ""Grain Seeds"" or ""Vegetable Seeds"" action space, you get 1 clay.","效果：立即获得1w2c，每次踩小麦种子或者蔬菜种子，都可以得1c。
强度：基本上是1w4c到1w6c的短反馈收益，缺c局且没有种子手段可以用，但是再次强调下，手拿种子本身就是低效的，亏本的。

用法：这张卡适合快速打出砖发展卡，如第一回合的餐具室、垃圾房、火炉。如果你没有种子手段，可以抓，中后期踩种子攒砖头，翻修打主发。搭配：餐具室、垃圾房、胡萝卜、新卡中的砖发展卡",,
C137,煤炭工,Charcoal Burner,T1,B,,炭焼き,如果整局游戏里没有作为饭基盘的卡，就更容易发挥。比如做“かまど→調理場”等，想自己让它多次发动。,"Each time any player (including you) plays or builds a baking improvement, you get 1 wood and 1 food.","效果：每当有人打火炉或壁炉或烤炉时，得1木1饭。
强度：相对前面的栽培较弱，基本上是长反馈5木5饭

效果：每次踩犁田或者犁播时，可以花1f多犁一块地。
强度：前两次犁田收益至少1.5分，第三次犁田至少0.5分。为什么是至少呢？因为田是生产资料，可以发展农业。所以总收益至少3.5分。由于可以发展农业，其实收益应该在短反馈四五分左右。

用法：2 职业后抢生时打出，中后期解决食物引 擎并补职业 搭配：职业流
变体：书架写字台比较考验水平，一般来说舒 服的节奏是先打三职业，准备好木头抢生打书 架和写字台，再打满7 职业，此时不需要特别 地打2 职业再单打1 职业再打书架，因为有可 能影响节奏。","Writing Desk Writing Desk Since this has a two Occ requirement, chances are

D039,松露切片器,Truffle Slicer,T3,,,トリュフスライサー,第8回合打出并且每回合启动1次就是7分。先拿到厨房的话，捡野猪的行动不容易浪费，也更容易解决食物。先拿到家具制作所的话，到最后只要一直去拿木头就能提高分数。,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, if you have at least 1 wild boar, you can pay 1 food for 1 bonus point.","条件：8 回合或之后 费用：1w
效果：如果你有至少1 猪，你每次去木头累积 行动格时，可以花1f买1 分。
强度：如果打出这张牌后要扩1 围满，是要吃 20 木的，这个20 木基本要6 动，每次0.5 收 益，一共3 收益。去除成本是2 收益的卡。但 是考虑到需求1 猪比较难拿到，以及部分套路 可以踩更多次木头，因此这张卡的真实收益在0 到4+，属于适用性低的下限低上限高卡牌，如 果有木头套装，可以刷很多分。
难度：3/5
用法：主要的三个点，一个是猪的获取，基本 要造2 马厩踩次2 猪，或者有猪卡更稳定。另 一个点是打出时机，有机会就要尽快在打出， 可以先打了卡再拿猪防止之后没有打卡时机。 最后一点在于木头的规划，基本上要至少4 屋 的，5 屋更好但是要有产木头手段，比如说伐木 工，木头推车，采莓，篮子，树木巡查员，都 是很适合的卡。 搭配：木头套装，产食物的卡 不搭：三房流，大量产木头的流派如林间客 栈、线人、树农，缺食物的流派",,

用法：轮抽时如果自己做5 屋可以拿这张卡， 最好有早田手段，至少要拿到5 屋2 田，做8 围。注意R14 要早点控到翻主，因为自己踩不 了翻围，还有注意早点踩播烤和农田。 搭配：5-6 屋流，违建流、先农后牧流 不搭：2-3 屋等超生流、农孩等犁播流、篱笆护 理等翻围流",,
D066,陶瓷器皿,Potter Ceramics,T1,,,陶磁器,有砖块辅助的话更容易活用,"Each time before you take a ""Bake Bread"" action, you can exchange 1 clay for 1 grain.","效果：每次你烤面包前，可以把至多1c转化为1麦。
强度：首先我们先明确砖的价值，在第一季初，大概是1砖2分，在二三季是1砖1分，再往后会贬值到低于0.5分，具体分析过程见之后的价值分析攻略。在打烤炉时，陶瓷器需要用4c1s打出，因此在第一季末或二三季打出的成本是可接受的，且基本不会被抢烤炉，打出时用5分换2分+5饭，之后的每次烤面包用0.5分换5饭。也就是在没配合的情况下，播烤+石烤1次得1.5收益，两次3.5收益，以此类推。
难度：4/5
用法：第一季优先走2rsf建房，拿一次4c，时机成熟就把烤炉扣了，如果是早羊局可以先扣火炉，如果有烤面包卡配合要早扣烤炉尽量r4-7扣出，观察别人有没有3c1s1麦，如果有就尽早抢。陶瓷器这张卡可以用于r1抢先，或者在第二季抢生、抢烤炉前一回合打出，各有利弊。早打可能被卡rsf或4c。配合：烘培 炉火 蒸汽机 连枷 打谷等烤面包卡，售土 运土这种给c卡不搭：宠物爱好者这种需求火炉又给麦子的卡，烧砖工这种用砖卡",,
D082,狩猎奖杯,Hunting Trophy,T3,,,狩りの記念品,如果有厨房的话，成本通常不会那么在意。不用效果也自带1VP，所以不差。注意改建成本无法减轻。,"Improvements built on ""House Redevelopment"" cost you 1 building resource of your choice less. Fences built on ""Farm Redevelopment"" cost you a total of 3 wood less.","条件：立即烹饪或丢弃1 猪
效果：1 分，每当你使用翻主打发展卡时，可以 少花费任意一个建筑资源，每当你使用翻围进 行围栅栏时，可以少花费至多3 木。
强度：可以看作是条件苛刻的3 收益卡。触发 翻围可以多拿到2 收益，但是条件很苛刻，翻 围只有一个，而且晚围是有节奏成本的。本身 的烹饪一猪推荐是马厩养2 猪，生出来的那个 烹饪掉。
难度：3/5
用法：早打马厩或者早围，早点拿个锅，养2 猪烹饪掉一只，最晚不超过第五季打这张卡， 赶紧翻修别被卡住了，如果有猪手段，推荐第 四季就打了就很舒服。 搭配：早马厩或者早围卡，迷你圈地，马厩规 划师、牧场主人，工匠木斧等。早猪卡如喂猪 人。强化翻围卡如篱笆护理员、碎石清理、横 切木。 不搭：早翻卡如石屋套，砖屋套",,
D091,犁田工,Plowman,T2,C,,鋤手,如果能在第1阶段打出，就能大幅压缩手牌。不过也没必要为了打出它而硬拖延增筑增员。要是畑看起来很紧的话，在第9～10回合使用，哪怕只拿到1块畑也不是坏效果。,"Add 4, 7, and 10 to the current round and place a field tile on each corresponding round space. At the start of these rounds, you can plow the field for 1 food.","效果：当前回合+4/7/10，放1田 那回合开始用1f买1田
强度：3f买3田，净收益4.5分 而且不止，田是生产资料，赋子了种子更高的价值，唯一的缺点是长反 馈，必须第一季出 难度：2/5 用法：难度2是因为要提前找好食物，然后四五季尽 量不犁田 准备好种子犁播 搭配：种子卡 不搭：犁田卡 前期卡 变体：如果你第一季有特别强的组合，可以把犁田工 放到第二季出，犁田工犁两田也不亏。","Plowman This is by far the best 'Plow' occ. He essentially gives 3 actions for the
price of 2 (1 to play him, 1 to collect the 3 food), which is an obviously good
deal. His utility is limited a bit by the fact that you sometimes can't afford
to wait around for the fields to come out.",
D114,,Seed Trader,,,,種商人,只要有饭就能大量买种子，不过还是很贵。如果有强力的饭基盘，那就是一个选项。,Place 2 grain and 2 vegetables on this card. You can buy them at any time. Each grain costs 2 food; each vegetable costs 3 food.,,,
D117,木材专家,Wood Expert,T2,,,木の専門家,如果有很多使用木材的进步，那么作为选项，在拿“家具制作”时所需的木材也能减轻。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 wood. Each improvement costs you up to 2 wood less, if you pay 1 food instead.","效果：打出时得2w，每次打发展卡时可以花1f减免1/2w
强度：一般来讲，轮抽拿到2张2w以上卡，3张1w卡是不难的，假如再拿到个井，一共花6f 省8木 送2木，相当于7左右的收益。但是问题在于，这张卡必须在前几抓拿到才能够规划自己的次要发展卡，而且要用早期的饭打第二季的次发，会变饿。
难度：3/5
用法：第一季打出，第二季省木头
变体：木专书柜 天胡开局",,
D128,,Building Tycoon,,,,建設の獅子,虽然很吃饭，但能把容易拥挤的增筑格子进行手牌压缩很优秀。不过也有依赖他人的一面，切勿过信。若其他玩家打出了这张卡，行动时要注意别让人插进增员格子。也可通过日雇农夫或左官进行的增筑来启动。,"Each time after another player builds 1 or more rooms, you can give them 1 food to build exactly 1 room yourself. (You must pay the building cost of the room.)",,,
D162,烧砖工,Clay Firer,T3,D,,レンガ焼き,像砖瓦匠那样，和能大量降下砖块的卡片成套使用吧。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 clay. At any time, you can turn clay into stone: you get 1 stone for 2 clay, and 2 stone for 3 clay.","效果：打出时立即获得2c，并且可以随时用3c换2s，2c换1s
强度：没有配合的话，本身只有早期高价值砖的2收益，但是考虑到有一些大量获取砖的手段，烧砖工可以在那些场景发挥较高的价值。比如有运土工的话，9砖的收入可以转化为6s，运土的5收益就提高到了6收益。
难度：3/5
用法：一般会在翻修前打出，出其不意翻修或出其不意抢主发，甚至达到卡住翻修、井等效果，让对手浪费大量建筑材料，打出超额收益。搭配：得砖手段，比如搬运工","Clay Firer Cards that convert one resource to another usually aren't good because the
deals they give are only marginally beneficial. If you're going to be spending
1F1A, you want to be getting good deals, not OK ones. This is one of the better conversion Occs, however, because 3 clay for 2 stone
can be a pretty good deal in games where people are valuing stone correctly.
However, the fact that you need to waste one action playing this card and then
another action collecting the clay when you could have just taken 2 or 3 stone
directly still makes this a fringe play.",
C025,蒸气机,Steam Machine,T4,,,蒸気機械,渔小剧场和家畜也是累积空间，所以相当容易发动,"Each work phase, if the last action space you use is an accumulation space, you can immediately afterward take a ""Bake Bread"" action.","费用：2w
效果：1 分，如果你每回合最后一个家庭成员在 积累行动格，你可以进行一次烤面包行动
强度：本身亏1 分，触发一次效果就回本的套 路牌
难度：2/5
用法：没配合就当一张上限卡，收益等同马 厩，木头溢出才有用。有配合陶瓷或者尤其是 手推车会很强。 搭配：陶瓷，手推车",,
C030,半木造,Half-Timbered House,T1,D,,木骨の小屋,想拿5分以上，但4分也足够高效。为防止出现“进步格子被占满而无法打出”之类的情况，从选秀时就要注意其他玩家在后期可能会打出的进步。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each stone room you have. You can only use one card to get bonus points for your stone house.","费用：1w1c2s1r
效果：每个石屋计1分，最多有1张卡给石屋计分
强度：在新卡中有一种新的流派叫6 屋流，以温馨，男管，旅馆，建师，房管B136为核心，偶尔会穿插石匠C087，鹰塔，扩屋卡。因此半木造的使用场景是4-6 屋流，或者是15 石流。收益是4-6 或10+。成本的话，在终局1w大概1分，1c2s1r不超过2分，因此成本不超过3，收益是1-3 或10+。
难度：2/5
用法：第四五季提前攒好资源，翻主打出半木造，或者是R13 抢先半木造，R14 翻修。搭配：扩屋流，6 屋流，15 屋流不搭：3 屋流，2屋流","Half-Timbered House Half-Timbered House In order to actually use this card, you'll need to
plan accordingly so that you end up with the right amount of every resource by
the end of the game, all while ensuring your stone renovation. Doing this is
usually too tricky to be worth the effort, and being forced to make an extra
resource grab or two just to play this can severely cut down on the card's VP
efficiency. Playing this off of your round 14 stone renovation
is always a rush, but if you had enough actions in the end game to gather the
necessary resources and play the card, you probably were going to win anyway.",
C059,烈酒蒸馏器,Schnapps Distillery,T3,,,シュナップス蒸留所,如果走蔬菜玩法就是饭补助+奖励分。话虽如此，打出的成本约等于3分，所以很难灵活运用,"In each feeding phase, you can use this card to turn exactly 1 vegetable into 5 food. During scoring, you get 1 bonus point each for your 5th and 6th vegetable.","费用：2s1 菜
效果：2 分，每个喂养阶段，你可以用至多1 菜 换5f，游戏结束时，你的第5、6 个菜分别额外 计1 分
强度：本身可以看作是负收益的卡，收益来自 于大量的额外菜源，本身亏1 菜，相当于3f， 这说明至少再蒸2 菜才能回本，然后要留一两 菜播种，也就是至少能产3-5 才用得起这张卡 回本，多了的每个菜在这张卡下有1 分收益。
难度：3/5
用法：只有早菜流才用得起这张卡，前期扣两 次rsf，然后打烈酒吃菜，但是注意两点：1.菜 不要吃断了，没菜播种了。2.石头有井优先打 井，这张卡不着急。 搭配：书柜等多菜早菜卡",,
C077,粘土补给,Clay Supply,,,,粘土補給,可以确保用于灶台炼窑的砖。要是有釣鐘铸造师就更好了,"Place 1 clay on each of the next 3 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the clay.",,,
C078,苇帽蟾蜍,Reed-Hatted Toad,T2,,,ヒキガエル,尽量想尽快打出。在芦苇看起来很重的场合，如果是第4手，也可以考虑首手用SP打出。,"Add 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 to the current round and place 1 reed on each corresponding round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the reed.","费用：1f
效果：在往后数5/7/9/11/13 回合各摆1r，回合 开始获得
强度：这张卡的常用场合是R1 的2 动打，此时 你放弃了2w，换去了1f 左右的抢先收益，而这 个收益和卡的成本抵消了，因此相当于用第一 季的2w换取5r，其中最后一个r基本上用不 到。剩下的4 个r有着5+分的总价值，而你花 费的2w大概价值3 分，因此收益是2+分。
难度：1/5
用法：轮抽时，如果你是1 号位且第一回合没 有别的抢先卡，尽量扣下这张，不然第二回合 要四号位坐牢；如果你是2 号位，那么这张卡 是不错的；如果是三四号位，选择这张卡要谨 慎，这意味着你要比一二号位打这张卡亏1 分 左右。在实战中，如果你第一回合没有打出这 张卡也没事，这张卡在R2-3 打出依然有着1+ 分的收益。更多细节可以回帖讨论。 搭配：芦苇工坊套卡牌，晚扩卡如木扩 不搭：茅草屋顶等不需要R的卡牌",,
C089,马厩大师,Stable Master,T4,,,厩の親方,前期打出的话，能进行成吉思汗+羊繁殖会很强力。中期以后也能用1行动1木准备繁殖空间，所以如果要吃掉家畜的话也不算差的效果。,"When you play this card, you can immediately build exactly 1 stable for 1 wood. Exactly one of your unfenced stables can hold up to 3 animals of one type.","效果：打出此卡后 你可以立即用1w建造至多1马厩你可以至多在一个未被圈地覆盖的马厩饲养三个同类型动物
强度：这张卡本身用1w换1分是不赚的，只有三个饲养空间有1-2分的价值，收益只有1-2十分可怜。在马厩套下，由于省了1w，可以达到2-3的价值。在某些特殊情况，如马厩规划师+马厩建筑家+休闲木匠 这种需要打满马厩 又不用踩扩屋时，可以达到省1动的价值，最高上限4-5分收益。
难度：2/5
用法：只有很少的时机适合这张卡，比如R11场上有三猪2牛但是没有其他人能拿，你可以快速拿到高价值动物。",,
C113,冬季管理员,Winter Caretaker,T2,,,冬場の管理人,虽然需要食物，但靠职业的一次行动就能凑齐蔬菜和小麦。要是蔬菜不够，最后一回合可以把食物转换成蔬菜，多加1分,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 grain. At the end of each harvest, you can buy exactly 1 vegetable for 2 food.","效果：打出时得1麦，每个收获结束时可以2f换1菜
强度：农有很多卡是瞬间得1麦+赠送效果，这张卡是这些卡中，旧卡里最强的，但是也很难用好，不推荐新手使用。4f换1麦2菜的话，大概有4分净收益，但是不止，因为在有壁炉时，可以每个收获净赚1f，会玩大概收益短反馈4.5分。
难度：4/5
用法：第四季打出，四季末和五季末得1菜，然后第六季一播种，标准用法。但是要提前准备好食物。然后第六季末烤一菜买一菜，净赚一饭。搭配：胡萝卜D079 犁田套
变体：冬管胡萝卜，极难组合，第一季打出冬管，控住首炉但是不吃，吃钓鱼或者卖艺+两次rsf，买1菜。第二季吃掉5-7羊，然后再买一菜，第三季打出胡萝卜乱杀。",,
C118,拾木工,Wood Collector,T2,C,,木材集め,除最终盘以外，无论什么时候打出都能有不错的表现。第一手打出当作增筑材使用的方法很容易理解。,"Place 1 wood on each of the next 5 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the wood.","效果：往后摆5w，每回合开始获得
强度：稳健的短反馈5w卡，木头全局保值，第一季到第三季打都不亏。

用法：有别的前期卡就二三季打，没有别的前期卡就第一季打。","Wood Collector I don't need to tell you how important wood is, and this occ gives you 5 of it
in a reasonably short amount of time. You're not going to be able to get more
wood early with any other play. His usefulness goes down, however, if you have a better early game occ to play,
since you're not going to tend to want to play this guy later in the game,
after the race to build the first room is over.",
C126,挖掘工,Excavator,,,,発掘者,单体也还不错。石头也能高效入手。后期砖头往往会变得没什么用，所以的话，最好能拿到制陶。,"Each time after you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you get 1 additional wood and clay, and you can buy 1 stone for 1 food.",,,
C128,木屋扩建工,Wooden Hut Extender,T1,,,木の家の建築士,因为延后增筑，就更容易一次性增筑2～3间。即便是「第4R最速增筑→第8回合增筑2间」这样的动作，也能减轻芦苇3木材4的负担，所以即使想追求最速增筑，也完全有打出的价值。,"Wood rooms now cost you 1 reed, and additionally 5 wood through round 5, 4 wood in rounds 6 and 7, and 3 wood in round 8 and later.","效果：你扩建木屋费用改成5w1r，第六回合及以后改为4w1r，第八回合及以后改成3w1r
强度：考虑到要拿首生，一般第一间推荐5w1r，第二三间推荐3w1r。总共省4w3r，前期r值钱，接近7分的短反馈收益。
难度：2/5
用法：难度在于把控扩房和生娃的节奏。不要早扩了生不到，也不要为了贪1木头晚扩亏一回合生。一般R1-5出，最好第一季就扩第一间，早期拿一次rsf。搭配：食物卡，小户农民，瓦匠，送砖卡保障翻修不搭：其他扩屋卡，除了木贸D119
变体：第一季不扩 直接R6扩2不过有末生的可能，需要对游戏理解较深再尝试",,
C152,木偶艺人,Puppeteer,T2,D,,人形使い,时机不稳定，但预计能发动3~4次。如果其他人打出了涂装艺术家等强力的小剧场相关卡牌，就相当优秀。,"Each time another player uses the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you can pay them 1 food to immediately play an occupation without paying an occupation cost.","效果：别人踩卖艺时，可以给他一 f，然后自己打一个职业
强度：理论上来说，三次触发 3 饭打 3 职业，相当于白送 3 动 有 6 分收益。但考虑到三饭给别人，而且自己不能踩卖艺，最高不超过 5.5 收益。而且有时只能打 2 职业，长反馈 3.5 收益，勉强回本。
难度：5/5
用法：这张卡是新手噩梦，往往出现 7 饭卖艺没人踩，甚至 14f 没人踩。有时你甚至用麦子换食物就为了白嫖打职业。或者因为花 1f 买了职业而踩临时工，或者因为扩屋卡迟迟不出则末生。我的建议是你要在轮抽时要观察，场上其他人的食物手段一定要少，自己的食物手段一定要多。如果你明明把陶瓷、鱼叉之类的放出去，或者烈酒放出去没回来时就要警惕，谨慎打木偶。木偶往往要 R3/4 打出，然后第一季踩 2/3 次 rsf 或者 4 饭钓鱼。尽量不要扣别的前期卡。
搭配：中后期卡 食物卡 职业套
不搭：家具匠 C116 家具匠要求食物给系统 你给其他玩家拿不到木头","Puppeteer This is a potentially powerful but extremely awkward card. For one, playing him
commits you to not taking the TP square in hopes that other people will take
it. Furthermore, you will never be sure exactly when someone will take TP,
making it hard to maximize the efficiency of your actions. Since the last time
TP is taken is usually quite late, you're going to need at least one late-game
VP occ that you don't care about when it comes out (Chief's Daughter,
Mendicant, etc.). Still, since TP is usually taken 3-4 times in a game, this can straight up save
you 2-3 actions. His value increases even more if someone plays a TP occ, since
that usually means the spot will be taken more often.",
C166,召牛人,Cattle Whisperer,T4,D,,牛使い,在第6回合之前打出来吧。就算没有牛系的连招，1手2牛也不是差的效果。拿到的牛想尽早繁殖。,"Add 5 and 8 to the current round and place 1 cattle on each corresponding round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the cattle.","效果：在当前回合+5/8各放1牛，回合开始获得。
强度：这张卡基本上是要吃4牛或者6牛的收益，如果要6牛，那么需要在11回合拿到2牛，也就是R3及之前打出，吃满5分，但是反馈过慢还要准备饲养空间。吃到4牛的4分需要在R5前打出，一般不考虑。
难度：2/5
用法：如上，尽量在奇数回合打出，R1打是5分+4饭，每往后2回合少1分，需要提前准备饲养空间。配合：牛计分卡，如挤奶凳 牧牛贵族不搭：前期卡","Cattle Whisperer: We have a house rule that whenever someone plays this card, they have to put
their finger on their mouth and say, 'Shhhhhhh!' His value is slightly worse than the Cattle Breeder, since you have to play him

效果：传递卡，你每有1s，就获得1w
强度：如果你攒够了翻修和一张主发的石头，大概有7-8 石，然后横切木一下拿7-8 木，是很恐怖的，净收益7-8，所付出的只是晚打主发只能挑别人剩下的，而且晚围拿不到太多动物。
难度：3/5
用法：前期rsf的优先级提高，中期不要打井，3s的优先级接近6 木。搭配：先农后牧卡",,
D038,挤奶凳,Milking Stool,T2,B,,搾乳台,如果能繁殖牛，就能成为食物补助+得分来源。可以的话想以最终6头为目标,"In the field phase of each harvest, if you have at least 1/3/5 cattle, you get 1/2/3 food. During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for every 2 cattle you have.","条件：2 职业 费用：1w
效果：每个收获阶段开始时，如果你有1/3/5 牛，得1/2/3f；游戏结束时，你每有2 牛就获得 1 分
强度：跟织布机在伯仲之间，织布机更需要前 期的锅和马厩，这张卡更需要后期的高质量动 充足，可以多拿牛。量化的话，终局吃2 分， 第六季吃2 饭，第四五季吃1 饭，分数在3 分 左右，但是打出时机可以比织布机晚。
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡不着急打，你可以观察下自己能 不能拿2 牛，能就抢先拿，不能就老老实实四 五季拿两次甚至更多的1 牛。 配合：早产牛、牧牛贵、黄油桶、挤奶棚等牛 卡 不搭：需要后期抢犁播或超生的规划方式的卡","Milking Stool Milking Stool The Milking Hand is a perfectly playable
occupation, and this is almost strictly better! If you can pick up a pair of

amazing deal for 1W, and things just get silly if you have an occupation that
enables early cattle.",
D041,马拉船,Horse-Drawn Boat,T3,,,馬力船,尽早出场，主要作用是作为饭补助。基本上和かま調成套使用,"Alternate placing 1 food and 1 sheep on each remaining round space, starting with food. At the start of these rounds, you get the respective good.","条件：3 职业 费用：2w
效果：往之后的每回合开始交替放1f 或1 羊， 先放f，回合开始获得
强度：三职业卡中几乎是最弱的一张，别的三 职业卡如“栎树林”、“工作证”、“木头推 车”都比这张强。我认为，三职业要求的卡往 往是亏大节奏的，因为他第一季的职业不好 抢，还花费了第一季的宝贵食物。打三职业可 以认为大概是首生变三生，亏了前期2 动也就 是4-8 分之间。马拉船如果在R5 打出，可以得 到9 回合收益，也就是13 饭左右，这个收益几 乎与成本持平了，可以看出本身是近乎无收 益、甚至负收益的。只有其他流派需要前期打 出3 职业时，才考虑打这张牌，那样子的话， 这张牌就有着13 饭减去2 木的大概4-5 分收 益。
难度：4/5
用法：不用，除非前期要打3 职业，或者锯木 场、木材专家、家具商等卡可以省动打出这张 卡。基本上1-2 号位才考虑抓这张牌，R1 打一 张职业，R2-5 打两张职业，然后速出马拉船， 之后四回合内拿到锅或者马厩不要浪费羊。 搭配：速职业流派，强化钓鱼套，强化零工 套， 不搭：前期家庭版流派，如羊生、麦床生、石 生",,
D043,兔笼,Hutch,T3,,,ウサギ小屋,前期的6食很优秀，但要注意不要让扩建变慢。趁芦苇变轻的时机打出也完全不算差。,"Place 0, 1, 2, and 3 food in this order on the next 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.","费用：1w+1r

D090,制犁工,Plow Maker,T2,D,,鋤鍛冶,无论是从序盘开始建小麦田，还是从中盘到终盘急着把版面填满，哪种情况都能发挥作用。有耕作者的话，先拿耕作者的饭，再付给锄锻冶的饭。,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"" or ""Cultivation"" action space, you can pay 1 food to plow 1 additional field.","效果：每次踩犁田或者犁播时，可以花 1f 多犁一块地。
强度：前两次犁田收益至少 1.5 分，第三次犁田至少 0.5 分。为什么是至少呢？因为田是生产资料，可以发展农业。所以总收益至少 3.5 分。由于可以发展农业，其实收益应该在短反馈四五分左右。
难度：2/5
用法：三四季打出，早犁，避免卷。","Plow Maker This is another trap card - he looks much stronger than he actually is. Let's assume that you play this guy with the intention of maxing fields. To get
5 fields, you're going to need 4 actions (1 to play the Occ, 3 to plow) and 3
food (1 to play the Occ, 2 to plow). This is not appreciably better than just
plowing a field 5 times, since the 3 food he costs will probably take another
action anyway.",
D107,,Bellfounder,,,,釣鐘鋳造師,单独使用时不太好运营，但有很多可以联动的卡牌，比如地质学家、黏土送货人、矿工等。,"In the returning home phase of each round, if you have at least 1 clay, you can use this card to discard all of your clay and get your choice of 3 food or 1 bonus point.",,,
D121,墙土修补工,Clay Plasterer,T3,D,,左官,从5栋木屋里仅仅拿出来用于改建，也相当于做了4砖的工作。不增建砖房也有拿出来的选项。,Renovating to clay only costs you exactly 1 clay and 1 reed. Each clay room only costs you 3 clay and 2 reed to build.,"效果：你翻修成砖屋改成1r+1c，你扩的每间砖屋改成2r+3c
强度：没配合的情况下可以省4c，超短反馈4收益。有配合的话可以和砌砖，架梁一次使用，扩砖屋。
难度：2/5
用法：可以搭配5房流，省4c，可能还能再c短缺的回合拿到关键主发。三四房就不要用了。","Clay Plasterer In 2-p, this can occasionally be worth it for the reduced renovation cost
alone, since it can save you 3 or 4 clay. In other player modes, you're going
to need to build clay rooms to make this work. This is usually an awkward
proposition, since it forces you to spend an early action on renovation - see
the Clay Hut Builder.",
D132,贫农,Hide Farmer,T3,C,,隠れ農夫,由于能把栅栏围得更小，因此实质上能作为木补助来发挥作用。有强力的盘外点的话很优秀，但基本上如果一直依赖这张卡就很容易出现分数不够的情况。不会变成负分，所以能拿到村长点。,"During scoring, you can pay 1 food each for any number of unused farmyard spaces. If you do, you do not lose points for these spaces.","效果：游戏结束时，你可以为你每个空地支付1f，以让这些空地不扣分。
强度：下限卡。考虑三房2田2围的情况，贫农可以获得8分，是4收益。贫农基本上会有1-4收益。但是，大量的空地本身就限制了农牧发展，只有在有大量食物获取手段，且不需要农牧这些生产资料时较强。
难度：5/5
用法：这张卡本身限制了农牧，你必须在少量的生产资料的条件下获取大量可计分资源，比如卡牌的饲养空间，或者卡牌的田地。此外，你还需要用省下的行动去换取更多分数，比如用蓝图抢大量主发，或者家教灯笼吹牛等提高上限的卡。
变体：有警官时，你的竞争对手可能会亏动卡你田，此时你打出贫农可以转危为安，让对手更亏。","Hide Farmer Second only to the Braggart in raw potential power, but suffers from several
weaknesses. Aside from the steep food cost, this card will always look better
on bad player's farms than yours. Weaker players tend to neglect early family
growth, putting them behind on farm development and ahead on food. If you have
been playing well, you might only have 2 or 3 unused spaces, and won't have
much food to spare. Still, if you have at least 3 unused spaces and plenty of food, he'll always be
worth the action. Potentially amazing if you are able to focus on Improvements

效果：传递卡，立即放置下一个家庭成员
强度：基本上价值等于一个3 木变6 木，也就 是3-4 分的收益
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡是bga 禁卡，特点是可以抢 1 生，如果你下家打出这张牌抢生，下下家可能 继续抢生，下下下家继续，然后自己的首生变 末生，是十分难受的。抢生的用法是抢先然后 另一个家庭成员扩屋，然后下回合直接生。另 一种用法是生娃时打出这张卡抢一些关键资 源，或者再次抢先（也就是扩2 间连生） 搭配：扩2 连生、晚扩抢生等流派",,

难度：2/5
用法：最好在第二三季打出，在三四季犁2 田，不要拖太晚的主要原因是其他人（尤其是 你下家）看到你打这个会优先犁田，这样子你 就必须在五六季抢先一动犁田了，这是很亏 的。另外要注意多拿木头，这张卡本身亏的3 木需要有效地填补上，此外，早拿种子早播对 于你的6 田来说是很高收益的，第四季的1 麦 1 菜，播三次就可以变成满麦满菜。 搭配：栽培，碎石等卡 EthanHuang: 简称大犁","Swing Plow Swing Plow The wood discount makes this more playable than

效果：往之后的所有偶数回合铺1w，回合开始 获得
强度：这张卡如果R1 打不出来，我推荐R4、5 再出，为什么呢？因为第一季的饭很大，而2-3 回合的抢先很小。我最近在贯彻落实一个思 想，就是前期压下肥上，后期压上肥下。简单 地说，就是前两季少抢先，让下家少扩屋，才 能自己舒服。如果R5 出，也有4 个有效木头， 收益2.5-3 分。如果R1 出，收益可以达到4- 4.5 分。这张卡强化了一二号位，压制了四号 位。
难度：1/5
用法：轮抽时，四号位尽量不要传这张卡到一 号位，一号位尽量不要传这张卡到二号位，严 防被坑。如果传递了这张卡，不要同时给下家 打职业和次发的机会。另外，如果R1 开主发格 子，持有这张卡的玩家请尽量打出职业，在主 发格子打私有林地也是极好的。 搭配：任务型工匠立即打出私有林地，乌木加 工等充分利用木头甚至R14 木头的玩家",,

Each time after you renovate, you get a number of wood equal to the number of people you placed that round.","效果：打出时得1砖1木（以后简称1c1w）每次翻修后得已放置家庭人员数的w

难度：4/5
用法：打了这张卡要时刻关注翻修的需求以及供给情况，以及都有哪些人能翻修，千万不要贪小便宜吃大亏。尽量不要打五房，能早翻就早翻，早翻早拿木头早围，养起来，很适合三房打。三动翻修两次7w1c，很稳健。搭配：套索，佃农B087，泥水修补工，烟囱清理工不搭：管理员

C167,买牛人,Cattle Buyer,T4,,,家畜買い取り人,吃买来的家畜效率不太好。想先把自己的栅栏拉好，也把食物基础打好。为了不至于饲养空间不够，有马厩的话就更好。,"Each time another player uses the ""Fencing"" action space, you can buy exactly 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle from the general supply for 1/2/2 food.","效果：其他玩家使用建造栅栏行动时，你可以支付1/2/2食物买羊/猪/牛。
强度：注意只有造栅栏行动格可以哦，翻围不可以，所以最好自己踩到翻围，每个人围一次的话就有3次左右。假设正好买三种动物，就是5饭买6分，那就是3.5分收益。实战中你每次自己拿一种动物，就会降低这张卡的收益1分。
难度：5/5
用法：这张卡用到上限的条件很苛刻，除了职业套凑凑人数外，最高的上限是自己一次动物都不拿，又踩到翻围，那适合什么情况呢？因为你要踩翻围又要养前期他们两次围给的动物，那你要前期早围一下，或者早打一个马厩。然后你，你想控翻围是要技巧的，数一下大家翻修够不够，不够的话你要抢R13的先，够的话也尽量不要末动，除非别人第五季就都石屋了，第六季没人抢你翻围。因此，这张卡要想清楚，而且准备好食物。搭配：先农后牧，上限卡",,
D010,白鹳巢,Stork's Nest,T2,,,コウノトリの巣,活跃机会较为有限，但如果职业契合就很优秀。由于增员会推迟，建议与像“木屋扩建师”那样能在后期追回扩建的卡牌搭配使用。,"In the returning home phase of each round, if you have more rooms than people, you can pay 1 food to take a ""Family Growth"" action.","条件：5 职业 费用：1r

效果：你每有一个饲养动物的圈地外马厩，计 一分，每种动物因此最多计一次。
强度：可以把这张卡理解为，强化最多3 个圈 地外马厩，每个多1 分。每个圈地外马厩本身 就具有1.5w换1 分的性质，因此这张卡让 5.5w换了6 分。5.5w在圈地中大概可以换4-5 分，因此这张卡带来的超额收益大概是1 分。
难度：3/5
用法：这张卡是要压制农业和畜牧业的，原本 围8 的畜牧要变成围6，原本围6 的畜牧要变 成围4，农田也因此要少做一个，是一张保下限 的卡。轮抽时最好抓到马厩流配合、中期给木 头、后期补动物的卡，减少田卡的需求。",,

难度：1/5
用法：尽量不要在三四季打出，留着五六季补 上限，三四季还要扣主发和早翻修呢。但是如 果暂时卡手，实在没有别的次发可以打了，也 别浪费次发机会，算好以后没空打绵羊井的 话，就早打也没关系的。 搭配：早圈羊卡",,

强度：正常情况下是1-2马厩的收益，1-3分收益，如果搭配栅栏修理员这种多踩栅栏的流派，会很棒。

强度：这张卡就算是只打次要发展卡，只打2次，也有着4木的收益，而且省去两个抢先。我们知道抢先总会亏分，所以这张卡至少有着5分的保底收益。考虑到可以打主发炉子或者井，每打一次主发都是货真价实的省下一次行动，而且大部分使用这张卡的人会造三间新房屋，因此上线可以接近10分。
难度：2/5
用法：这张卡要在第一季打出，货真价实的前期卡。轮抽时要拿2-3张各个阶段的木头次发，用于省1木，不要都拿前期次发（比如大温室，运粮推车），前期造不了这么多房子。在第一季时，要想好自己第一间屋子打什么卡，一般是火炉或者手上的前期次发，全局尽量不抢先。不要太贪，想着一次造2屋，容易被卡生。由于送2木，第一季应当更多的去拿芦苇，rsf是很好的选择，可以为第二间屋子打井做好准备。搭配：瓦匠B095，蓝图C027，垃圾房，建筑大师，石匠C087不搭：锯木场，木材专家，因为很少有这么多2个以上木头的次要发展卡
变体：提三点吧，首先不要因为想贪主发就扩到5，你没有木匠B126，木贸D119这种扩房卡就老老实实四屋翻修，留木头围。另一点是这张卡给15石屋更高的上限。。因为你在扩15石屋的过程可以打十三张次要或主要发展卡，这种情况不一定第一季出。最后一点，如果有瓦匠，一定要尽早扩五，搬空主发，亏动也要这样做，因为主发不等人。",,

强度：基本上是踩1-2次麦子，踩一次的话，就是单纯的1麦，也就是2收益。如果是踩2次，相当于1分+6饭的收益，可以到4收益，当然前提是有烤炉。如果没有烤炉，只有壁炉，相当于1分+4饭收益，3收益也可以接受。
难度：2/5
用法：基本上有麦子的配合才会考虑用。配合：菜贩，农巡，养牛妇，谷物勺，街头叫卖等","Seed Seller If you are going to want 2 grain to sow into 2 fields, he is always worth it.

B011,饲料园,Feedyard,T3,,,畝,虽然有条件，但每次收获最多可获得4饭。注意是在食料供给之后获得饭这一点。由于在繁殖阶段后立刻发动，别忘了进行家畜的重新配置,"This card can hold 1 animal for each pasture you have, even different types. After the breeding phase of each harvest, you get 1 food for each unused spot on this card.",,,
B012,牲畜围栏,Stockyard,T2,,,家畜収容所,即使没有牧场，也能从序盘开始繁殖家畜。把家畜用于食用的情况下更容易发挥作用，但即便不这样也不是坏效果。,This card can hold up to 3 animals of the same type. (It is not considered a pasture).,,,
B014,鹰塔,Hawktower,T1,,,鷹の塔,与石家相关的卡牌成套运用会更容易上手，但即使没有辅助，只要根据打法也完全有望充分发挥作用。没有辅助的情况下，准备石之屋4栋会变得相当忙，所以稳妥起见还是留在3栋为好。,"Place a stone room on round space 12. If you live in a stone house at the start of the round, you can build the stone room at no cost. Otherwise, discard the stone room.",,,
B015,木工台,Carpenter's Bench,T2,,C,工作台,分4次拿到11根木头就能拉出15格篱笆。算下来相当于减轻了3木+建篱笆这1手的成本。因为能频繁拉篱笆，也更容易进行家畜繁殖，还能瞄准启动篱笆系combo。,"Immediately after each time you use a wood accumulation space, you can use the taken wood (and only that) to build exactly 1 pasture. If you do, one of the fences is free.",,,这张卡就是我觉得他是一张非常陷阱的卡。因为它看起来是赚三根木头和一动，但是第一他对栅栏的大小有要求。就是说你本身你在拿木头的时候，你栅栏只能往外围，而不能在中间插零碎的栅栏。所以拿木头的时候势必会有多余的木头，不会拿的那么整齐。第二的话，如果你是职业打的比较多的卡组的话，后期一定是会有从卡牌里获得了木头的，不会说所有木头都是从场上去获得。你在这种情况下，后期的木头其实没有第二个特别优秀的转化途径。一般来讲我觉得用这张卡大部分情况下，他可能只发动一次到两次，后期再去把剩下的木头围成栅栏结束这一把。它的真实的收益就是说提供一个比较早的饲养空间，然后木头上不赚不亏。他就可以相当于是一张免费的饲养空间卡，但是就是会亏一点前期节奏。后期使用第二次的时候多给一个木头，就是他全部的作用。一张零成本的饲养空间卡，这就是我对他的定义。
B017,森林犁,Forest Plow,T1,,,森林鋤,基本上是从中后盘开始启动。在森林启动→用SP下回合去森林的走法很强,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you can pay 2 wood to plow 1 field. Place the paid wood on the accumulation space (for the next visitor).",,,
B018,草原耙,Grassland Harrow,T3,,F,草地鍬,2木进行1田的转换效率很微妙。职业条件和资材量的调整等，难以处理的点非常多。,"Add 1 to the current round for each building resource in your supply and place 1 field on the corresponding round space. A the start of the round, you can plow the field.",,,这张卡垃圾啊，没用，把所有条件都去了才能用

B021,Hayloft Barn,Hayloft Barn,T0,,A,干し草倉,用在第3～第5个人的位置都很强。如果做了小麦田，就能自然地增员。总共能获得4食料这一点也很大。一次收获不管收获多少个小麦都只发动1次，但在有种子商店的状态下进入小麦时，可以发动2次效果。,"Place 4 food on this card. Each time you obtain at least 1 grain, you also get 1 food from this card. Once it is empty, you get a ""Family Growth Even without Room"" action.",,,应该算是一个A级卡。从理论上来讲，它是应该符合一张S级卡的效果的。但是从实际上来讲，就是因为理论上来讲，它你其实在第九回合能够生出来的话，它都有一个S卡的价值。但是实际上就是你生他的过程是亏动的。三木和四麦子算底平的话，你再去生娃的过程中，你这个四个麦子，平均来讲在没有配合的情况下，或者说你在70%以上的情况下，这张卡都是要亏2动以上的。就是如果说你在你希望用他生第一个娃，这张卡通常会亏掉三动左右。如果你用他生第二个娃的话，通常是从卡里面获得两个麦子，在手中拿两个麦子，这时候你再第九季把它生出来，它相当于亏七动，但是你手中拿了两个麦子亏了一动，它的总体收益就是5~6个。所以它就是一个强A卡。就是相比于和这个七分的，这个就是和九回合打出来能够获得七分的礼拜堂来讲，这两张卡效果其实大差不差。然后也会有一些非常优质的配合，比如礼拜堂可以配合声卡强大的声卡，然后这张卡是可以配合一些就是能够快速给麦子的卡，还有一些农业上的卡，也各有一些配合。没有配合的情况下，这两张卡收益大差不差。
B022,步行靴,Walking Boots,T1,,C,旅行靴,可以增加1手还能拿到食物，但因家族点导致的上限分会减少。如果是3人以下进行的话，缺点也不那么容易在意。,"You immediately get 2 food. You must immediately place a person from your supply. If you do, in the next returning home phase, you must remove that person from play.",,,"效果：给一动和食物
强度：就是一张很符合说的就是通用，然后给一动这个特征。两个饭多给了一点收益，但是他还有一个副作用。和这两口饭基本底线就是约等于送一动。不过考虑到有时候他这个送的这一动是一个非常大的一动，如果你在生娃阶段打出来的话，它其实是超过一动的。但是另一个角度讲，他在你在这个速一动的卡，还是前面那句话，速一动的卡大部分情况下，你是希望他是能够在任何在你没有次发可打的情况下去打他。所以就是一个普通的用，没有那么强。算是送一动里最强的那一档，但是他从强度来讲还是达不到送一动的水平。再加上他的这个副作用也不是每个卡组都能承受，所以大概就在这个位置。"

Only you can use it until it is placed on the game board.,,,我觉得效果很一般。就是你在什么时候会需要一次翻修。那就是在大部分情况下，你如果就是在最后一回合前凑够了木头，那通常直接去翻修了就好了。最后一回合你再拿一点资源，然后翻修去打一张卡，这样的话行动才用的比较充分。你在最后一回合前翻修的话，那你最后一回合都可以选，这个行动就比较尴尬了。你在最后一回合就没有一个稳定能够末端属于你的行动去拿的。通常情况下，你要是房子比较多的话，你最后最后一回合你有好几个人，你可以让他们去拿点资源再打个发展卡或者之类什么的。但是最终章你在前一回合这个操作的话，他可能只能就是适用于那种对于翻修特别紧张，比如秘书这种卡组是可以用最终章保一下翻修的。通常卡组的话，我觉得最终章这张卡约等于一张没条件的白板，就是没条件也没收益。
B026,农业栅栏,Agrarian Fences,T2,,,耕地の垣根,减少栅栏事故+手牌压缩。中盘以后穀物活用也可能会很挤，所以要注意尽早去做，避免被卡掉。原本处于无法进入穀物活用的状态时，即使持有这张卡也进不去。,"Each time you use the ""Grain Utilization"" action space, you can take a ""Build Fences"" action instead of one of the two actions provide by the action space.",,,
B027,工具箱,Toolbox,T2,,D,工具箱,想和石头补助或降低进步费用的效果搭配使用。根据场上情况来选择成本较轻的资材工业吧。,"In the work phase, after each turn in which you build at least 1 room, stable, or fence, you can build the ""Joinery"", ""pottery"", or Basketmaker's Workshop"" major improvement.",,,很简明的配件卡。就是如果你想打多个工坊，而且是打打出速度有要求的话，就是你想在后期第三季到第四季去打多个工坊，工具箱可以为你提供两动的收益。
B028,林业研究,Forestry Studies,T2,,,林学教育,只能在木3格时发动，但效果强力。想和SP配套，使其能够到达5木。,"Each time after you use the ""Forest"" accumulation space, you can return 2 wood to that space to play 1 occupation without paying an occupation costs.",,,
B029,烹饪课程,Cookery Lesson,T3,,D,料理教室,与能在职业格获得家畜的交易教师或动物训练师成套运用吧。,"Each time you use a ""Lesson"" action space and a cooking improvement on the same turn, you get 1 bonus point.",,,烹饪课程净收益其实还是蛮高的，他的净收益是可以达到3动的水平。但是这张卡呢，就是由于他的条件实在是太苛刻了。他首先你需要在很早的时候去打出来它，而且划掉宝贵的两饭。从这个角度的话，如果你在早期花掉两饭去打出来它，而且你的这个它本身的价值就已经降低到一个两动了，还不能算作一个三动的加减。然后你打出来它之后，你还需要满足你必须有锅，有动物，而且吃一口打一张烤炉。所以总体他的条件太苛刻了。理论上三动，实际上通常是两动。所以说只能放在一个D卡的水平。而且他也并没有什么普适性，大部分情况下这个卡甚至获得两分都很困难，获得两分都要有损失。因为有时候你在没有饲养空间的情况下，房间里那只宠物是不想吃的，吃了的话，你后期又要花一动去把宠物补回来，那是非常亏的。所以说他是在极特殊的卡组里才可以打出。
B030,木栅栏,Wood Palisades,T2,,,棒杭柵,,"Instead of a fence piece, you can place 2 wood from your supply on the fence spaces at the edge of your farmyard. These fence spaces with 2 wood are worth 1 bonus point.",,,
B031,陶器园,Pottery Yard,T2,,C,製陶所の敷地,即使把栅栏围得小一点也能抵消空白空间的负分，所以实质上可以作为木材补助来使用。,"During the scoring, if there are at least 2 orthogonally adjacent unused spaces in your farm, you get 2 bonus points. (You still get the negative points for those unused spaces.",,,这张卡我还是比较喜欢的。这张卡从收益来讲是两分，两个空地给一分，然后基础给一分，一共两分。一张两分的卡。然后打出条件的，说实话不算太苛刻。就是这个打出条件也不算很高，你有一个陶艺工坊就可以了。陶艺工坊也是相当于，你可以理解为你放弃争夺井的话，你通常是可以争夺到陶艺工坊的。损失大概在0.5分左右，相当于它的净收益还是有1.5分这个样子的。然后没有打出条件，所以这张卡就是没有打，不需要额外的资源，所以这张卡还是不错的。这张卡或提一分上限一分下限，而且能配合一些空地计分的东西。
B032,釜,Kettle,T3,,B,煮沸釜,因为可以随时无限次启动，所以也可以把3小麦转换成9饭。只要能获得足够的小麦，仅靠这个也能解决饭的问题，但为了获得奖励分，转换效率并不是很好。,"At any time, you can exchange 1/3/5 grain for 3/4/5 food and 0/1/2 bonus points.",,,也算是一张麦子的核心卡。他给的饭非常多，你就有了釜加上麦子你就可以做，就是可以跟很多消耗食物的卡配合。从这个角度来讲还是比较强的。他和这个东方火炉都差不多，算是一档。它们都是能够用一张卡去解决掉很多食物问题。然后你强在他除了解决食物问题之外，它还可以送给你一些分数。但是釜的弱点在于打出条件太苛刻了。就是你首先要有一个砖头，其次你必须先播种完麦田才可以打福。这是一个非常难以达成的事情。你在最需要饭的时间里很难享受到釜给的饭，这是一件非常尴尬的事情。
B034,特色食物,Special Food,T2,,B,特別な餌,大致在大多数场面下，能在中盘之前就打出，并且不费力地瞄准2分左右。,"The next time you take animals from an accumulation space and accommodate all of them on your farm, you get 1 bonus point for each of these animals.",,,是极其优质的分数，两分是它的基本收益，大多数情况下这张卡是一个无条件两分，而且他可以有四分的梦想，有上限有下限，愿不愿意为绕着他做就看后面的发牌，后面你发一张饲养空间卡，直接用它做到四分五分都是可能的，所以说这张卡总体收益还是比较高的。但是嗯这个也是一张环境卡，就是看环境里大家吃动物的意愿，如果环境里吃动物的选手比较多，或者做饲养空间的选手比较多的话，可能要降到一个C档，但是在环境里面比较正常的环境下的话，它也是有一个B挡的强度的。
B035,钩刀,Hook Knife,T3,,,Hook knife,注意：不仅是获得羊后立刻烤来吃，还必须饲养才行。羊繁殖本身相对于所需的繁殖空间不太容易转化为分数，这是个瓶颈。,"Once this game, when you have 9/8/7/6/5/5 sheep on your farm in a 1-/2-3-/4-/5-/6- player game, you immediately get 2 bonus points.",,,
B037,农庄,Grange,,,,大農場の称号,虽然希望能有某种田地辅助，但如果能高效地提升盘面分数，就能顺势打出来，这点很开心。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 food.",,,
B038,未来建筑用地,Future Building Site,T3,,E,建設予定地,相较于3点奖励来说，缺点相当大。,"Up until all other farmyard spaces are used, you cannot use the unused spaces that are orthogonally adjacent to your house.",,,这张卡就非常简单，特殊配合的强度下值一动，就是说本身三分，起始花一动打出来它然后获得三分，这就是一个就是也没有啥赚头的事情，这个限制条件相当于对你无所谓的情况下它是不赚不亏的，不是太强
B040,啤酒厂池塘,Brewery Pond,T1,,,醸造所の池,单体也足够强。连招时更是不必多说,"Each time you use the ""Fishing"" or ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you also get 1 grain and 1 wood.",,,
B041,栎树林,Hauberg,T1,,,ハウベルグ,要学会灵活运用野猪来周旋。如果有厨房的话可以把野猪烤了立刻回收3饭，所以更容易出。,"Alternate placing 2 wood and 1 wild boar on the next 4 round spaces. You decide what to start with. At the start of these rounds, you get the goods.",,,
B042,林间客栈,Forest Inn,T3,,,森の宿屋,成本和条件都很重，但行动效果很强力。考虑木材的高效用法，尽量自己想进入的行动格。因为木材和食料都能供给，分数整体上很容易膨胀。,"This is an action space for all. A player who uses it can exchange 5/7/9 wood for 8 wood and 2/4/7 food. When another player uses it, they must first pay you 1 food.",,,
B043,小餐馆,Chophouse,T3,,,料理店,即使没有连招，只要小麦和蔬菜各进一次就是5饭，所以还算不错。和田地看守或私人教师搭配的话会非常强力。,"Each time you use the ""Grain/Vegetable Seed"" action space, place 1 food on each of the next 3/2 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
B044,雏鸡窝,Chick Stable,T2,,,ひな小屋,前期的4食物很受用。,"Add 3 and 4 to the current round and place 2 food on each corresponding round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
B046,俱乐部会所,Club House,,,,会館,虽然费用偏重，但作为前期的食物补助还算不错。比起木3，更想用砖2来出的一张卡。1R第2手就去进2砖吧。,"Place 1 food on each of the next 4 round spaces and 1 stone on the round space after that. At the start of these rounds, you get the respective good.",,,
B048,森林巨石,Forest Stone,T2,,,森の石,序盘拿出来的话算是还不错的食物补助,"Place 2 food on this card. Each time you use a wood accumulation space, move 1 of these food to your supply. Each time you use a stone accumulation space, add 2 food to this card.",,,
B049,天平,Scales,T1,,,天秤,在构建好饭基盘之前作为过渡还算可以。序盘大概发动3次拿到6饭就已经是足够的效果了。,"Each time after you place an improvement or occupation in front of you, if you then have the same number of improvements and occupations in play, you get 2 food.",,,
B051,挖掘铲,Digging Spade,T3,,,採掘シャベル,猪繁殖的优先度会大幅提高。作为砖的用途也希望有制陶,"Each time you use a clay accumulation space, you also get a number of food equal to the number of wild boar in your farmyard.",,,
B052,发展农场,Growing Farm,T4,,,成育農場,效果相当粗犷，但条件和成本都很重。可以在R9用8格12本牧场或在R10用9格12本牧场启动。与同系卡不同，不是降饭而是能立刻拿到，这点很让人高兴。,"You can only play this card if you have at least as many pasture spaces as the number of completed rounds. If you do, you get a number of food equal to the current round.",,,
B053,雕塑课程,Sculpture Course,T3,,,彫刻学科,前期能把用途不多的石头变成4饭这一点很大。只要去石芦就能让食料充裕。和交易教师很契合。,"At the end of each round that does not end with a harvest, you can use this card to exchange your choice of 1 wood for 2 food, or 1 stone for 4 food.",,,
B054,施肥车,Tumbrel,T3,,,肥料運搬車,如果有木補助或厩補助的话，就会成为相当不错的饭補助。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 food. Each time after you take an unconditional ""Sow"" action, you get 1 food for each stable you have.",,,
B055,维修费,Maintenance Premium,T2,,,整備保証,还算不错的饭补。,"Place 3 food on this card. Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you get 1 food from this card. Each time you renovate restock this card to 3 food.",,,
B058,除草刀,Crack Weeder,T3,,,雑草掻き,大概能到1木3饭左右，所以算及格分,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 food. For each vegetable you take from a field in the field phase of a harvest, you also get 1 food.",,,
B059,食物箱,Food Chest,T3,,,食料箱,只有1木2饭的话会感觉有点不够。即使通过“改筑大进”打出也不会发动，所以要注意,"If you play this card on the ""Major Improvement"" action space, you immediately get 4 food. Otherwise, you get only 2 food.",,,
B060,酿酒山泉,Brewing Water,T4,,,仕込み水,虽然有时间差，但1小麦6饭是惊人的饭效率。像酿造所的池、补给船等，通过捕鱼能出小麦的卡也意外地多,"Each time you use the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, you can pay 1 grain to place 1 food on each of the next 6 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
B063,品鉴会,Tasting,T3,,,味見,如果能产出很多小麦的话还算不错。扣除上课成本后是2~3饭，所以终究只是饭补助。,"Each time you use a ""Lessons"" action space, before paying the occupation cost, you can exchange 1 grain for 4 food.",,,
B064,水车,Mill Wheel,T4,,,水車の輪,成本太重、发动条件、效果，全部都不够,"Each time you use the ""Grain Utilization"" action space while the ""Fishing"" accumulation space is occupied, you get an additional 2 food.",,,
B065,粮仓,Grain Depot,T2,,B,小麦貯蔵庫,能根据手头资源来运用的还算不错的小麦辅助。大多数情况下，把砖转换掉应该是最有效率的吧。由于木匠专家的效果，如果只用饭来支付打出，就会导致效果无法发动。,"If you paid wood/clay/stone for this card, place 1 grain on each of the next 2/3/4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the grain.",,,可能是一张比镰刀还要强的麦子卡。因为谷仓给的太快了，谷仓的麦子甚至可以用来做麦田的东西。它只需要三回合就可以，你拿两个砖打三回合就给你三个麦子。或许可以做麦田、做桶或者做茅草，这些都是可以的。所以谷仓的话，他可以认为是一张就是非常具有普适性的两份收益的卡。算是在B级里都算是比较强的。不过毕竟麦子卡有个问题是麦子卡是相互冲突的，所以通常不是一抓，二抓三抓还不错。
B067,手推车,Hand Truck,T1,,,手押し台車,与烤面包棒、蒸汽机、炉灶生火等成套搭配的话会变得相当好动。即使拿不到窑，也可以在厨房烤面包。不持有“烤面包”的进步就无法启动效果。与面包师不契合，注意。,"Each time before you take a ""Bake Bread"" action, you also get 1 grain for each of your people occupying an accumulation space.",,,
B069,陶艺市场,Potters Market,T3,,,陶工市,2木3砖2饭换2蔬菜1分，在物资较轻的局里还算不错。如果要用这张卡多次来收集蔬菜，那就老老实实把蔬菜播到田里去增殖吧。成本偏重和时间差让人用起来不顺手。,"At any time, you can pay 4 clay and 2 food. If you do, place 1 vegetable on each of the next 2 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the vegetable.",,,
B070,购置新货,New Purchase,T3,,,新規購入,只要能出饭，就能大幅压缩回合数。不过果然还是有点费用偏高。,"Before the start of each round that ends with a harvest, you can buy one of each of the following crops: 2 Food → 1 Grain; 4 Food → 1 Vegetable",,,
B071,丰收之家,Harvest House,T1,,,収穫小屋,虽然有条件，但“种子套装”和“2分1饭”是很优秀的效果。以田地为主推进时作为种子补助也不错，而且在直到终盘都完全没有获得种子的状态下各获得1个小麦和蔬菜也很强。即使效果不生效，也可以作为2分卡来用。,"When you play this card, if the number of completed harvests is equal to the number of occupations you played, you immediately get 1 food, 1 grain, and 1 vegetable.",,,
B072,热爱农艺,Love for Agriculture,T2,,,農業愛,,"You can sow crops in pastures covering 1 or 2 farmyard spaces. If you do, these pastures are also considered fields and hold 1 and 2 animals less, respectively.",,,
B073,礼物筐,Gift Basket,T2,,,贈り物かご,想拿蔬菜。因为这张卡本身带1点，所以用小麦也还可以。,"When you play this card, if you have exactly 2/3/4/5 rooms, you immediately get 1 vegetable/food/grain/vegetable.",,,
B075,木材车间,Wood Workshop,T1,,B,木工作業場,前期要打出来的话条件和成本有点尴尬，但如果能打出来，应该能稳定产出大约6木。在打出进步之前就能获得木材，所以即使在成本差1木的情况下也能打出进步了。想第一手从“资材囤积屋”打出来。,"Each time before you play or build an improvement, you get 1 wood.",,,勉强算是梦想卡，然后你有一点基础收益虽然都不算很高。那这个收益就是通常情况下，通常情况下呢就是用一般打六个发展卡，然后他如果在第一个发展卡的位置打出来的话，他们可以获得五个。总算是一张中规中矩的卡牌。他的弱点是在于他需要打出来的时间特别早，把木头其实给的非常远。这个木头兑现速度实在太慢了，而收益也没有那么高。这张卡整体收益高，哪怕你在非常特殊的考试里，他也就是个九个木头左右，而且还会影响你前期的节奏。但是他这个卡超过一动这也是毫无疑问的，C卡里应该没有能够和这个卡一较高下。
B076,天花板,Ceilings,T1,,B,天井,改建会稍微受限，但可以把1砖转换成5木。想从初手就从囤积资源屋出牌。,"Place 1 wood on the next 5 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the wood. Remove the wood promised by this card from future round spaces the next time you renovate.",,,这是一张和木材车间比较像的卡。这张卡应该是要比木材车间是要更强一点的。就是天花板和木材车间相比的话，因为天花板给的快。虽然他这个限制条件也算是一个有条件，但是有时候有四个也未尝不可。你在打出来他的下一回合给一个木头这件事，其实是就是会让你在生娃打发展卡这件事情有更多的选择空间。收益和车间差不多，多一个限制条件但是给的快。大部分情况下应该比木材之间略强一点，但是总体上是一个级别的卡。
B078,芦苇带,Reed Belt,T3,,,葦の群生帯,虽然是想在序盘打出的卡，但费用偏重，且在发挥作用前的时间差也很大。如果是芦苇偏重的场面，即使在第6回合以后打出也能充分发挥作用。,"Place 1 reed on each of the remaining space for rounds 5, 8, 10, and 12. At the start of these rounds, you get the reed.",,,
B079,提煤筐,Corf,T3,,,荷揚げかご,虽然是想在中盘之前打出的卡，但芦苇1的费用偏重。石头紧缺的局面下也可能会一直被用2石拿走，因此很难。,"Each time any player (including you) takes at least 3 stone from an accumulation space, you get 1 stone from the general supply.",,,
B081,手拉车,Handcart,T3,,E,手引き車,虽然能发挥效果的场合不算多，但在木材或砖块较轻的局面下也会出现6木或5砖的情况，所以要看清场上的状况再打出。搭便车跟随森林保护者是比较稳妥的。,"Before each work phase, you can take 1 building resource from at most one wood/clay/reed/stone accumulation space containing at least 6/5/4/4 building resources of the same type.",,,大致情况下应该还是能够获得两次，但是要求打的时间太早，就导致一张非常的发展卡的话，能够拿两到三个资源不是很能令人满意。而且也是一个同样的问题，就是给的时间太拖，导致他基本上就变成了一张特殊的配合。不过你拿他和那张就是567的资源给木头砖头的那个职业相比的话，大家都没有配合情况下，还是手拉车要强一点。就是如果你没有其他想要打的前期发展卡的话，那你把手拉车打出来可能是要比一个一分白板的效果要好，这就是它的意义。
B082,价值资产,Value Assets,T3,,,資産価値,每次收获只要出木材就已经足够了。后期在确保不足的改建材料方面也很优秀。如果其他玩家在出的话，要注意能不能在收获阶段获得资源把改建格子填上。,"After each harvest, you can buy exactly one of the following goods: 1 Food → 1 Wood; 1 Food → 1 Clay; 2 Food → 1 Reed; 2 Food → 1 Stone",,,
B083,泥潭,Muddy Puddles,T2,,,泥溜り,要全部拿完的话总共需要7块砖，所以和辅助一起套装,"Pile (from bottom to top) 1 wild boar, 1 food, 1 cattle, 1 food, and 1 sheep on this card. At any time, you can pay 1 clay to take the top good.",,,"效果：优质一三白板
强度：和这个和这个牛头骨差不多，俩都是优质一分版本。"
B085,农场短工,Farm Hand,T2,,,作手,,"Once you have 4 field tiles arranged in a 2x2, you can use a ""Build Stables"" action to build a stable in the center of the 2x2. This stable provides room for a person but no animal.",,,
B086,松露搜寻者,Truffle Searcher,T4,,,トリュフ探し,猪的关联卡较少，但也不坏，可以通过繁殖来作为饭的补助来利用。由于阶段顺序是食料供给→繁殖，所以即使在食料供给前养到最大数量，繁殖后也不需要放跑它们,This card can hold a number of wild boar equal to the number of completed feeding phases.,,,
B088,尊贵之人,Established Person,T2,,,成功者,和砖房增筑或石房连招组合一起用。增筑时用不上的木头还能拿去做篱笆，这点很厉害。把繁殖体系整备起来吧。,"If your house has exactly 2 rooms, immediately renovate it without paying any building resources. If you do, you can immediately afterward take a ""Build Fences"" action.",,,
B090,合作犁田工,Cooperative Plower,T4,,,組合の鋤手,序盘想要小麦田的时候打出，或者蹭别人的小麦combo。自己想两边都做去抢小麦的话，要是田地先被人占满就会非常难受,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"" action space while the ""Grain Seeds"" action space is occupied, you can plow 1 additional field.",,,
B092,针线编制工,Little Stick Knitter,T2,,,靴下編み,如果只有自己能去成吉思汗的话就很优秀。一旦出现灶台料理场的竞争，马上就会变得很难周旋。,"From Round 5 on, each time you use the ""sheep Market"" accumulation space, you can also take a ""Family Growth with Room Only"" action.",,,
B093,密友,Confidant,T1,,,腹心の友,终盘双方往往都会很拥挤，因此能进行相当程度的手牌压缩。因为可以执行“柵”的行动，所以能和“生け垣管理人”形成combo。由于并不是在使用行动空间，所以和“家畜警護”不契合。,"Place 1 food from your supply on each of the next 2, 3, or 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food back and your choice of a ""sow"" or ""Build Fences"" action.",,,
B094,家畜守护者,Stock Protector,T2,,,家畜警護,可以稳定地做到柵→3木这种行动。连打柵→SP的话其他玩家会因为柵事故而死，但自己的分也不容易涨，所以更容易让自己下一个回合的人获胜。,"Each time before you use the ""Fencing"" action space, you get 2 wood. Immediately after that ""Fencing"" action, you can place another person.",,,
B096,树农木匠,Tree Farm Joiner,T1,,,養樹園の指物師,2木2小进步,"Place 1 wood on each of the next 2 odd-numbered round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the wood and, immediately afterward, a ""Minor Improvement"" action.",,,
B100,邋遢之人,Clutterer,T3,,,散らかし屋,总之还是看手牌。家庭教师的变种。没有能用大进步应对的卡。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each card played after this on that has ""accumulation space(s)"" in its text.",,,
B101,Furniture Carpenter,Furniture Carpenter,T4,,,建具大工,2饭1分的得分效率还算不错。不过如果饭不充裕的话，就会变得有点难启动。木材一直都属于需求偏高的资源，所以家具制造不太容易被拿走。若是木材相对轻的场面，家具制造就更容易被拿走，因此发动机会也会增加。,"Each harvest, if any player (including you) owns the Joinery or an upgrade thereof, you can buy exactly 1 bonus point for 2 food.",,,
B103,农场商人,Field Merchant,T3,,,畑の取引人,效果有点难以发挥，但只要能拿到1蔬菜就算十分有用了。想要通过改建大进步来顺利发动效果。由于“装备品齐全”并不是获得了进步行动，因此无法发动这张卡的效果。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood and 1 reed. Each time you decline a ""Minor/Major Improvement"" action, you get 1 food/vegetable instead.",,,
B105,制箱工,Case Builder,T3,,,箱造り,如果是以追求种系连招为目的的手牌的话，效果还算不错,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 good of each of the following types, If you have at least 2 of that good in your supply already, food, grain, vegetable, reed, wood.",,,
B106,道德宣传者,Moral Crusader,T3,,,清廉潔白な人,私有林和蟾蜍的简易Combo。只要其中一方有物品就行，所以14R有物品的话，全回合都会发饭。即使物品有多个，能拿到的食料也只有1。,"Immediately before the start of each round, if there are goods on the remaining round space that are promised to you, you get 1 food.",,,
B110,铺路工,Pavior,T1,,,路面舗装工,大概能产出10饭左右。最后还能拿到蔬菜也很开心,"At the end of each preparation phase, if you have at least 1 stone in your supply, you get 1 food. In round 14, you get 1 vegetable instead.",,,
B111,乡土之人,Rustic,T3,,,純朴な人,有多个砖增筑系的卡时会爆发性地发光。用砖房把盘面填满吧。,"For each clay room you build, you get 2 food and 1 bonus point. (this does not apply to stone rooms and renovated wood rooms.)",,,
B112,谷仓守卫,Silokeeper,T3,,,サイロ番,非常容易受运气左右。如果无论如何都想要小麦补助，那就放出来吧。去满足发动条件的田地种类那里时，先获得小麦，然后可以把那小麦播下去。,"Each time you use the action space card that has been revealed right before the most recent harvest, you also get 1 grain.",,,
B113,土地照料者,Patch Caregiver,T3,,,苗床の管理人,如果是播种类的连招，因为可以用1手凑齐田地和种子，所以很优秀。,"When you play this card, you can choose to buy 1 grain for 1 food, or 1 vegetable for 3 food. This card is a field.",,,
B115,锡匠大师,Tinsmith Master,T3,,,板金工の親方,两个效果都略显朴素，不太容易有效活用。因为能种下蔬菜并增加2个，所以也可以种上几个然后在厨房吃掉。虽然用7根栅栏就能繁殖2种，但仅凭这点效果还是不够满足。,"You can hold 1 additional animal in each pasture without a stable. Each time you sow in a field, you can place 1 additional crop of the respective type in that field.",,,
B116,河岸林务官,Shoreforester,T3,,,岸辺の林業者,如果芦苇很紧张的话，去拿1芦苇也不坏。也能和“酿造所的池”等芦苇场连动组合相契合。,"When you play this card and each time 1 reed is placed on an empty ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space in the preparation phase, you get 1 wood.",,,
B117,线人,Informant,T1,,,情報屋,在较宽松的条件下也能产出大约10木。也要记住可以通过右上角的熔炉按钮丢弃资材。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood. After each work phase, if you have more stone than clay in your supply, you get 1 wood.",,,
B119,伐木达人,Lumberjack,T3,,,杣人,中盘抽到大约7张后再打出会很强力。有小牧场的话会变成5木卡。,"You immediately get 1 wood. Additionally, place 1 wood on each of the next round spaces, up to the number of fences you built. At the start of these rounds, you get the wood.",,,
B120,打扫,Sweep,T3,,,掃除屋,,"Each time before you use the action space card left of the card that has been most recently placed on a round space, you get 2 clay.",,,
B122,矿物学者,Mineralogist,T3,,,鉱物学者,与砖块系连招组合成套,"Each time you use a clay/stone accumulation space, you also get 1 of the other good, stone/clay.",,,
B124,牧场修边工,Trimmer,T3,,,整地人,把栅栏分两次拉的话相当于4石，但终盘是否还有石头的用处就很可疑了。和工作台或家畜警护等能从多次分批拉栅栏中获益的卡牌搭配使用吧。,"In each work phase, after you enclose at least one farmyard space, you get 2 stone. (Subdividing an existing pasture does not count.)",,,
B125,庄园工人,Estate Worker,T2,,,借地農夫,虽然有时间差，但能入手包括石、芦在内的4种资材还算不错。若是用于增筑的芦看起来很紧张的局，就尽早把它拿出来吧。,"Place 1 wood, 1 clay, 1 reed, and 1 stone in this order on the next 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the respective building resource.",,,
B127,魅惑者,Seducer,T2,,,女たらし,几乎是和“交易教师”或“收集者”成套的卡。大多数情况下老老实实地增筑增员会更强。打出这张卡后就算再增筑1间房，家人也会自己住进去，所以无法进行增员。打出这张卡时即使用“交易教师”的效果拿取物品，也不能用拿到的物品来进行增员。,"When you play this card in round 5 or later, you can immediately pay 1 stone, 1 grain, 1 vegetable, and 1 sheep to take a ""Family Growth Even without Room"" action.",,,
B128,管道工,Plumber,T3,,,配管工,前期打出可瞄准砖和石屋连携。中期以后打出也可用于辅助改建。由于大进格子有时容易被占满，需注意。,"Each time after you use the ""Major Improvement"" action space, you can take a ""renovation"" action, paying 2 clay or 2 stone less for the renovation.",,,
B129,同桌,Seatmate,T3,,,隣り合わせた人,能在最终回合使用强力的行动并不坏，但这取决于会出现什么行动，所以无论如何都很不稳定。对面的玩家要是用了那个行动，就会非常难受。,You can use the action space on round space 13 even if it is occupied by one or more people of the players to your immediate left and right.,,,
B130,全职农夫,Full Peasant,T3,,,汎農,建议与“家畜警护”等这种去栅栏或种パン多次也有收益的卡搭配使用。中盘以后，（有这张卡的话就更是）这两个格子也有可能在一开始就被占满，所以要注意。,"Each time after you use the ""Grain Utilization"" or ""Fencing"" action space while the other is unoccupied, you can pay 1 food to use the other space with the same person.",,,
B131,武装者,Equipper,T2,,,装備品揃え,如果想要打出很多强力的进步，这个效果不算坏。有建築設計図时会大放异彩。可以用拿到的木材来打出进步,"Immediately after each time you use a wood accumulation space, you can play a minor improvement.",,,
B132,庄园主人,Estate Master,T0,,,地主,收集蔬菜补助和田地补助吧。第5步只要种2次蔬菜也有4分，所以就算补助不多也能争取发挥。,"Once you have no unused farmyard spaces left, you get 1 bonus point for each vegetable that you harvest.",,,
B133,乡村壮丁,Village Peasant,T3,,,村の農婦,由于蔬菜1个相当于1点，所以很多时候能不费力地拿出大约2点。,"At the start of scoring, you get a number of vegetables equal to the smallest of the numbers of major improvements, minor improvements, and occupations you have.",,,
B134,铜版画大师,Housebook Master,T3,,,名家録の編纂者,3分+3食物相当于小井，非常值得瞄准。如果还有其他石屋系卡牌的话，优先度会相当高。,"After playing this card, if you renovate to stone in round 13/12/11 or before, you immediately get 1/2/3 food and 1/2/3 bonus points.",,,
B135,营养专家,Nutrition Expert,T3,,,栄養士,因为每回合都能起动，所以即使单卡也有可能成为饭基盘的卡。想把拿饭确保的大进的手转去繁殖种まき，让它能够起动。希望在小麦、蔬菜、家畜之中，建立起能稳定供给其中2种的体制。,"At the start of each round, you can exchange a set comprised of 1 animal of any type, 1 grain, and 1 vegetable for 5 food and 2 bonus points.",,,
B137,批发商,Wholesaler,T2,,,卸売業者,能稳定成套拿到家畜很开心。可以的话想让它们繁殖。蔬菜补助也很珍贵，所以也很开心。,"Place 1 vegetable, 1 wild boar, 1 stone, and 1 cattle on this card. Each time you use an action space card on round spaces 8 to 11, you get the corresponding good from this card.",,,
B138,森林守护者,Forest Guardian,T3,,,森の守護者,如果有森林保护者就放进选项里。除此之外很难瞄准起动，效果也比较朴素。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 wood. Each time before another player takes at least 5 wood from an accumulation space, they must first pay you 1 food.",,,
B139,森林科学家,Forest Scientist,T4,,,森林科学者,如果是有玩家会去2木或1木的盘面的话……。如果自己要出松露切片器或烧畑农家之类的话，因为自己进1木也不坏，所以会成为选项之一,"In the returning home phase of each round, if there is no wood left on the game board, you get 1 food—from round 5 on, even 2 food.",,,
B140,庭院工人,Farmyard Worker,T3,,,農場労働者,,"At the end of each work phase in which you placed at least 1 good on 1 of your farmyard spaces, you get 2 food.",,,
B141,农田看护者,Field Caretaker,T2,,,畑の世話人,拿6砖后把3砖换成3小麦，通过“砖窑烤面包”→“播种+烤面包”可以做出10饭+1小麦田。即使没有砖也能一手凑齐小麦和田地，所以更容易做小麦田。,"When you play this card, you can immediately exchange 0/1/3 clay for 1/2/3 grain. This card is a field.",,,
B143,黏土看守者,Clay Warden,T2,,,粘土守,如果别人好像在瞄准连招，就打出来吧。如果没有其他任何连招，就会火力不足。,"Each time another player uses the ""Hollow"" accumulation space, you get 1 clay. In a 3-/4-player game, you also get 1 additional clay/food.",,,
B144,煤矿工,Collier,T3,,,坑夫,在粘土坑能拿到木芦很优秀。有砖增筑系的话会更闪耀。,"Each time after you use the ""Clay Pit"" or ""Hollow"" accumulation space, you get 1 wood. On ""Clay Pit"" you also get 1 additional reed.",,,
B146,幻术师,Illusionist,T2,,,イリュージョニスト,想根据场上的情况巧妙增加不足的资材。大家都优先扩建增员的结果，在芦苇和木材变得沉重的局面里，这张卡看起来最能发挥作用。因为一旦打出“灯笼的家”，就无法发挥这张卡的效果，所以要特别注意。,"Each time you use a building resource accumulation space, you can discard exactly 1 card from your hand to get 1 additional building resource of the accumulating type.",,,
B147,狩猎者,Huntsman,T4,,,緑衣の狩人,既然已经出了，还是想至少启动2次来进行繁殖，但费用太重了。如果连用“资材的空间”消耗种子来获得并运营家畜都很困难的话，要活用它也很困难。,"Each time after you use a wood accumulation space, you can pay 1 grain to get 1 wild boar.",,,
B148,宠物经纪人,Pet Broker,T2,,,ペット仲買人,在牧场空间较少的情况下能发挥作用，但羊的缺点是相对于繁殖空间而言得分效率有点差。如果没有羊的话，也可以作为14R的得分行动来用。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 sheep. You can keep 1 sheep on each occupation in front of you.",,,
B149,户外农民,Open Air Farmer,T1,,,屋外飼育人,可以减轻4木和栅栏行动的负担。在木头紧张的局面里强得离谱。无论是序中盘想以繁殖为目标，还是中盘辅助扎栅栏，都很优秀。,"When you play this card, you remove exactly 3 stables in your supply from play to build a pasture covering 2 farmyard spaces. You only need to pay a total of 2 wood for fences",,,
B150,大户农民,Large-Scale Farmer,T3,,,大規模農家,如果有进步系连招就放进选项里。两边都不空着就用不了效果，真让人难过。和家具调达人比起来差距也太大了。,"Each time after you use the ""Farm Expansion"" or ""Major Improvement"" action space while the other is unoccupied, you can pay 1 food to use that other space with the same person.",,,
B151,农家小孩,Little Peasant,T1,,,小百姓,中盘以后增建多间房屋或一直保持2间房都有效。也可以无视自家的家人，所以1饭职业或无房增员的行动空间也能在1回合内使用2次。与特定的行动格强化、森林保护者相性很好。,"You immediately get 1 stone. As long as you live in a wooden house with exactly 2 rooms, actions spaces—excluding Meeting Place—are not considered occupied for you.",,,
B152,少年艺术家,Junior Artist,T2,,,駆け出し画家,单独使用的话只是白赚1饭，所以基本上是和日雇いcombo成套运用。,"Each time after you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you can pay 1 food to use an unoccupied ""Traveling Players"" or ""Lessons"" action space with the same person.",,,
B153,房主,Housemaster,T2,,,寮長,注意：有时拿取灶台厨房会导致奖励分减少。只拿取井户的情况下相当于2分的行动。不包含家具制作等的素材奖励分。,"During scoring, total the point values of your major improvements. The smallest value counts double. If the total is at least 5/7/9/11, you get 1/2/3/4 bonus points.",,,
B154,羊群看守,Sheep Keeper,T3,,,羊持ち,虽然很难确保饲养空间，但3分2饭很优秀。如果有织布机等羊相关卡牌成套的话会相当强力。,"You can only play this card if you have less than 7 sheep. Once this game, when you have 7 sheep on your farm, you immediately get 3 bonus points and 2 food.",,,
B155,艺术导师,Art Teacher,T2,,,美術教師,与赞助人相比，它只有在支付职业费用时才会发动，作为饭补助略逊一筹，但打出时的效果还算不错，因此如果是职业Combo就很优秀。由于小剧场会减少饭，导致整个场面的饭会更紧张，所以希望事先准备好某种食料基础。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood and 1 reed. Each time you pay an occupation cost, you can use food from the ""traveling Players"" accumulation space.",,,
B157,腌制工,Salter,T3,,,塩作り,虽然有时间差，但拥有惊人的饭效率。序盘在家畜市场买几次牛，想在中盘以后把食料行动省出来。注意必须先养起来，否则无法转换这一点。,"At any time, you can pay 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle from you farm. If you do, place 1 food on each of the next 3/5/7 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
B158,区域经理,District Manager,T3,,,森林地区管理,如果有能利用森林格进行连续回合的内地管理员，就可以瞄准并触发。并且如果有玩家进行小动作强化，就更容易活跃。有像松露切片器之类、能成为多次跑树理由的卡的话，也可以考虑打出。,"At the end of each work phase, if you used both the ""Forest"" and ""Grove"" accumulation spaces, you get 5 food.",,,
B159,陆军中将,Lieutenant General,T2,,,農家の大将,如果除自己以外的玩家合计耕了9块田的话，大概是4饭2小麦。能入手小麦只限定在第14轮，所以有点不好用。如果出很多犁系的话就能发光。,"For each field tile that another player places next to an existing field tile, you get 1 food from the general supply. In round 14, you get 1 grain instead.",,,
B160,酒吧老板,Pub Owner,T3,,,飲み屋の亭主,有点依赖他人而略显不稳定，但还算不错的小麦补助。只空着1处，如果看起来没人去的话就自己去。,"Immediately, when you play this card, and at the end of each work phase, in which the ""Forest"", ""Clay Pit"", and ""Reed Bank"" accumulation spaces are all occupied, you get 1 grain.",,,
B161,虚弱之人,Weakling,T0,,,軟弱者,如果场上饭补助很多、导致很难进入5饭的话，就能更容易入手源源不断的蔬菜。此外，若场上有很多强化次要行动的要素，场上的资材也更容易余下，因此也更容易发挥作用。读懂场上的倾向来使用吧。,"Each time it is your turn in the work phase, if there are one or more accumulation spaces with 5+ goods on them and you do not use any of them, you get 1 vegetable.",,,
B162,森林砍伐者,Forest Clearer,T1,,,伐採人,令和的伐木工。有森林保护者在场会减少发动机会，注意。反过来，蘑菇搜寻和森林犁更容易增加进入木材累积的机会，因此相性很好。,"Each time you obtain exactly 2/3/4 wood from a wood accumulation space, you get 1 additional wood and 1/0/1 food.",,,
B165,野味供应商,Game Provider,T4,,,獲物調達人,如果只是2头猪左右，很多场面也不会被抢走，所以很少会为了把这张卡打出来还要付小麦去拿。和调理场成套的话，小麦田会成为饭基盘。,"Immediately before each harvest, you can discard 1/3/4 grain from different fields to get 1/2/3 wild boars.",,,
B167,圈舍警官,Stable Sergeant,T1,,,厩舎長,无论是最后赶着把家畜凑齐的时候，还是从中盘开始瞄准家畜繁殖的时候，哪种情况都有发挥的机会。,"When you play this card, you can pay 2 food to get 1 sheep, 1 wild boar, and 1 cattle, but only if you can accommodate all three animals on your farm.",,,
B168,牧场主人,Pasture Master,T3,,,牧畜の達人,发动条件很苛刻，但如果能把只有1只的家畜繁殖起来，效果就相当显著。如果木补助很丰富的话就更容易瞄准。有2牧场2厩的话，同种的家畜也能拿到2只,"Each time you renovate, you get 2 food and 1 additional animal of the respective type in each of your pastures with stable.",,,
C001,彻底重建,Overhaul,T2,,,オーバーホール,大概会增加2分。注意不是可以用手头的木头来立栅栏。和新土地成套时会大幅爆发,"Immediately raze all of your fences, add up to 3 fences from your supply, and rebuild them. (You do not lose any animals during this.)",,,
C004,写字板,Writing Boards,T2,,,筆記板,终盘SP→下回合栅栏、的动作很不错,You immediately get 1 wood for each occupation you have in front of you.,,,
C005,重构,Remodeling,T2,,,改装,在已经是砖房的状态下打出，然后来增建砖房吧。,You immediately get 1 clay for each clay room and for each major improvement you have.,,,
C007,弹簧剪,Blade Shears,T3,,,刈り鋏,1木3饭不差，但牧场1是瓶颈,You immediately get your choice of 3 food or 1 food for each sheep you have. (Keep the sheep.),,,
C008,植物肥料,Plant Fertilizer,T3,,,植物性肥料,如果能增加2处以上就太好了,"In each field with exactly 1 good, you can immediately place 1 additional good of the same type.",,,
C009,自动饮水槽,Automatic Water Trough,T3,,,自動水受け皿,让我们把抓到的家畜繁殖起来吧,"If you can accommodate the animal, you can immediately buy 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle for 0/1/2 food.",,,
C010,上下铺,Bunk Beds,T1,,,二段ベッド,条件偏重，但能用1木实现增员就很超规格。,"Once you have 4 rooms, your house can hold 5 people.",,,"效果：无条件预防
强度：算是一张就是无条件预防，无条件一空间的卡。我觉得他相比这个比这个铁锤，上下铺比铁锤要更强一点。它比铁锤可以更晚打出来，然后在两个都是都是不违建，因为铁锤毕竟违建成可能性更高。东西没见的情况下，上下铺和水相比的就是少了一个法师的分数，但是上下普攻打出来的非常稳，而且具有稳定性，可以偷袭。第二资源还是少几个的，就综合这两点的话，它比铁锤应该是要强的，可以放在这个位置。"
C012,Cattle Farm,Cattle Farm,T4,,,牛牧場,频繁拉起围栏、以繁殖为目标的玩法中能发挥作用。,"For each pasture you have, you can keep 1 cattle on this card.",,,
C013,木质滑锤,Wood Slide Hammer,T1,,,突破木槌,虽然有条件，但效率非常高。希望能多 확보 木补助和增筑补助。,"On your first renovation, if you have at least 5 wood rooms, you can renovate to stone directly and you get a discount of 2 stone on the renovation cost.",,,
C015,网状围栏,Trellis,T2,,,猟師の囲い,在终盘有时会拥挤的栅栏行动上不容易出事故。因为是先建栅栏的效果，所以建好栅栏后还能养猪。,"Each time before you use the ""Pig Market"" accumulation space, you can take a ""Build Fences"" action. (You must pay wood for the fences as usual.)",,,
C017,新犁的田,Newly-Plowed Field,T2,,,新しい畑,时机把握很难，但能无成本拿到田地很优秀。,"When you play this card, you can immediately plow 1 field, which needs not be adjacent to another field.",,,
C018,翻转犁,Roll-Over Plow,T3,,,回転鋤,因为可以增加农田，所以和年轻农夫等的播种辅助搭配一起运用吧。,"At any time, if you have at least 3 planted fields, you can discard all goods from one of those fields to plow 1 field.",,,
C020,开沟犁,Mole Plow,T2,,,もぐら鋤,1手出2块田很优秀，但成本太重以及能出的回合太晚就有点微妙,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"" or ""Cultivation"" action space, you can plow 1 additional field.",,,
C021,心形石头,Heart of Stone,T3,,,石の心臓,至少如果没有额外空间的话……,"Each time a ""Quarry"" accumulation space is revealed, if you have room in your house, you can immediately take a ""Family Growth"" action without placing a person.",,,
C022,藤椅,Basket Chair,T1,,,籠椅子,需要芦苇作为代价、但附带1分并稍微强化的马车旅行。可以从增员进步打出再增员1人，或是畑種→SP后再次进入畑種等行动。不过需要注意的是，如果没有空闲的家族成员就无法使用效果。,"When you play this card, you can immediately move the first person you placed this work phase to this card. If you do, immediately afterward, you can place another person.",,,
C023,工作合同,Job Contract,T1,,,雇用契約,只放入成本较低一侧的职业格。单独使用时是可发动格子减少了的Patron，但与日雇いcombo搭配就能发挥真正价值。如果第4手拿到这个，从先手SP开始出也不坏。,"If both are unoccupied, you can use the ""Day Laborer"" and the adjacent ""Lessons"" action space with a single person (in that order). Afterward, both spaces are considered occupied.",,,
C024,麦田里的床,Bed in the Grain Field,T2,,,小麦畑のベッド,与草屋等前期农田系组合一起,"At the start of the next harvest, you get a ""Family Growth"" action if you have room for the newborn.",,,
C028,讲台桌,Teacher's Desk,T0,,,教師机,多拿一些想在中后期打出的职业会更容易活用。与年轻农夫或小商人形成连招。在打出进步之前先打出职业的效果。即使通过大进步或改建大进步打出这张卡本身也不会触发。,"Each time you use the ""Major Improvement"" or ""House Redevelopment"" action space, you can also play 1 occupation at an occupation cost of 1 food.",,,
C029,啤酒桌,Beer Table,T1,,,ビールテーブル,能把1小麦转换成2点是独一无二的。确保拿到小麦、畑补助、播种补助，尽早准备好小麦田吧。,"At the end of the field phase of each harvest, you can pay 1 grain from your supply to get 2 bonus points. If you do, all other players get 1 food each.",,,
C031,写作室,Writing Chamber,T1,,,書斎,如果有无心的学生或收藏家就毫无怨言地强力。在木材很紧的局面里可以把栅栏拉得更小，或者在终盘把捡家畜或种子的1手用在别的事情上，发挥空间很广。也能和担保联动。和隐蔽农夫不联动。,"During scoring, you get a number of bonus points equal to the total of negative points you have, to a maximum of 7 bonus points.",,,
C032,凸肚窗,Abort Oriel,T3,,,張出便所,虽然是中盘以后难以打出的卡，但在序盘打出的话，砖块2的费用偏重。,You can no longer play this card when any player (including you) has 5 or more cards in front of them.,,,
C033,绿化工程,Greening Plan,T2,,,緑化計画,得分效率很优秀。要发挥这张卡的话，终盘无法进行播种，种子不容易增加这一点有些碍事。,"During scoring, if you then have at least 2/4/5/6 unplanted fields, you get 1/2/3/5 bonus points.",,,
C034,象草种植,Elephantgrass Plant,T4,,,ナピアグラス培養機,仅凭打出的费用就相当于2点的价值，所以既然出了就想至少起动3次,"Immediately after each harvest, you can use this card to exchange exactly 1 reed for 1 bonus point.",,,
C036,黏土种植床,Clay Deposit,T3,E,,粘土地帯,能启动3次左右就足够。有制陶的话到终盘都更容易进行得分行动,"Immediately after each time you use a clay accumulation space, you can exchange 1 clay for 1 bonus point. If you do, place the clay on the accumulation space.",,"Clay Deposit Clay Deposit 1F is often well worth 5 clay, so you need to be
careful about when, if ever, you play this card. You don't want to be giving
your opponents options! Moreover, the benefit this gives you is just about as
dubious - even if you want clay, if you spend an action to play it and an
action to use it, you've spent 2 actions for 5 clay - that's pretty mediocre.
The choice to take 2 VP is fine fine , but usually you'll have a way to do that anyway, whether
it's by plowing fields or taking singleton animals to stay in your home. Overall, the high occupation requirement, zero VPs
and questionable benefit makes it one of the worst cards you can draw. The only
real use I see for it is as a desperation move in 2-p, after your opponent has
denied you clay.",
C038,基督教,Christianity,T3,,,基督教信仰,有条件但无成本2点,"When you play this card, all other players get 1 food each.",,,
C039,工作船,Studio Boat,T3,,,アトリエボート,和小剧场连携一起用吧。,"Each time you use the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you also get 1 bonus point. In games with 1-3 players, this card is considered ""Traveling Players"" (same effect as ""Fishing"").",,,
C040,帆布袋,Canvas Sack,T1,,,ズタ袋,第一手从资源市场用SP出来，下一手第一轮捡2芦苇是常见套路。也可以先拿小麦之后再转换成蔬菜，但在不出职业、还要花两手去拿蔬菜的场面似乎不太多。,"When you play this card paying grain/reed for it, you immediately get 1 vegetable/4 wood.",,,"效果：优质前期卡
强度：就是这个优质前期卡。帆布袋这张卡，他在这个前期，他和这个他这两个东西是收益差不多。这个东西多一分，然后这个东西后期资源稍微多一点，他俩收益差不多，算是同一个级别的。就是看你能拿到的是RSF还是三个。感觉相比来讲的话，这个的打出条件要比帆布袋要更低一点，毕竟帆布袋要求四职业。"
C043,农场建筑,Farm Building,T3,,,農舎,成本很重，即效性也弱。如果有建筑设计图之类的，就会成为选项。,"Each time you build a major improvement, place 1 food on each of the next 3 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
C045,炖菜,Stew,T2,,,シチュー,单体就算用小动作也能1回合6饭，很优秀。连招时更不用说了,"Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, also place 1 food on each of the next 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
C046,刨刀,Mandoline,T3,,,マンドリン,如果能稳定供应蔬菜就很优秀。蔬菜本身相当于1VP，所以在蔬菜较少的状态下不要勉强消耗。,"Once per round, you can pay 1 vegetable to get 1 bonus point. If you do, place 1 food on each of the next 2 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
C047,菜园爪,Garden Claw,T4,,,園芸用熊手,序中盘如果有2块以上的田地，就可以说效果还算不错。,"Place 1 food on each remaining round space, up to three times the number of planted fields you have. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
C048,农庄,Farmstead,T3,,,農園,,"After each turn in which you make at least one unused farmyard space used, you get 1 food.",,,
C049,啤酒棚舍,Beer Stall,T2,,,ビール屋台,虽然有“空的厩”这一条件，但不花回合就能把1小麦转换成5食料非常优秀。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, for each empty unfenced stable you have, you can exchange 1 grain for 5 food.",,,
C050,马厩庭院,Stable Yard,T3,,,厩の庭,在第11轮打出，能变成1分+3饭就谢天谢地了。把它转换成牛的效果几乎没什么机会能发挥。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 food for each completed round left to play. At any time, you can exchange 1 sheep plus 1 wild boar for 1 cattle.",,,
C052,猎人帽,Huntsman's Hat,T3,,,猟師の帽子,效果很朴素。只有持有“かま調”的情况下才能使用的1芦1分卡,"For each new wild boar you get from the effect of an action space, you also get 1 food.",,,
C053,吉普赛瓦罐,Gypsy's Crock,T3,,,三つ足やかん,虽然自带1分，但成本略偏高。饭也并不能大幅增加。,"Each time you use a cooking improvement to turn 2 goods into food at the same time, you get 1 additional food.",,,
C054,市场摊位,Market Stall,T2,,,屋台,虽然牧场的上限点会降低，但不消耗手番就能把1小麦转换成5食料这一点极其优秀。如果耕很多田地的话，栅栏减少的缺点也就不太在意了。,"After the field phase of each harvest, you can exchange 1 grain plus 1 fence (both from your supply) for 5 food.",,,
C055,工作室,Studio,T3,,,アトリエ,虽然打出成本偏重，但作为饭补助还算不错。想在用发掘者等能大量产石的场面中使用。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, you can use this card to turn exactly 1 wood/clay/stone into 2/2/3 food.",,,"效果：食物
强度：这个卡我用的不多，但是他的兑换效率还是可以接受的。算是一张比较弱的方法，用的不多，我其实也不太好评价吧，就防着点。"
C057,蔬菜沙拉,Crudité,T2,,,生野菜,如果有2个蔬菜和2块田地，那么每次播种都会附带8饭，所以光靠这一点就足以解决食料。只要能获得1个蔬菜，就可以通过播种增加，因此希望有某种获取蔬菜的手段。,"When you play this card, you can immediately buy exactly 1 vegetable for 3 food. At any time, you can discard 1 vegetable on top of another vegetable in a field to get 4 food.",,,"效果：蔬菜
强度：他这张卡变魔术的情况有点少啊，一般情况下就和这俩卡算是一个级别。"
C058,木工技术,Woodcraft,T3,,,木彫,发动的机会并不那么多。,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, if immediately afterward you have at most 5 wood in your supply, you get 1 food.",,,
C060,陶艺工烤炉,Small Potter's Oven,T1,,,陶工の小窯,,"When you play this card, you immediately get 5 food. Each time before you get a ""Bake Bread"" action, you can build the ""Clay Oven"" or ""stone Oven"" major improvement.",,,
C061,啤酒杯,Beer Stein,T3,,,ビールジョッキ,1小麦转换成1点2饭在转换效率上很优秀。想做出能多产小麦的盘面。注意：必须至少烤1个面包才能发动。,"Each time you take a ""Bake Bread"" action, you can use this card once to turn 1 grain into 2 food and 1 bonus point.",,,
C062,扩建灶台,Cooking Hearth Extension,T3,,,調理場の拡張,,"Each harvest, you can use each of your cooking improvements once to get double the amount of food for 1 animal or vegetable.",,,
C063,精酿啤酒厂,Craft Brewery,T0,,,クラフトビール醸造所,2小麦换2分4饭非常高效。基本就是建造并运营2小麦田。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, you can use this card to exchange 1 grain from your supply plus 1 grain from a field for 2 bonus points and 4 food.",,,
C064,玉米杜松子酒蒸馏器,Corn Schnapps Distillery,T3,,,穀物蒸留酒製造所,成本较重，在很多情况下，老老实实先拿窯，一边播种一边烤面包会更稳妥。作为没能拿到窯时的保险来用,"Once per round, you can pay 1 grain to place 1 food on each of the next 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
C066,永续黑麦栽培,Eternal Rye Cultivation,T3,,,永遠のライ麦畑,建2~3块小麦田，尽量也能拿到小麦吧,"After each harvest in which you have 2 or 3+ grain in your supply, you get 1 food and 1 additional grain, respectively.",,,
C067,矿物饲料,Mineral Feeder,T3,,,ミネラルフィーダー,虽然需要先拉好栅栏，但作为小麦补助还算不错。中盘以后因为收获间隔变短，触发机会就会减少。如果养在家里则不会触发。,"At the start of each round that does not end with a harvest, if you have at least 1 sheep in a pasture, you get 1 grain.",,,
C069,土地整顿,Land Consolidation,T3,,,区画整理,,"At any time, you can exchange 3 grain in a field for 1 vegetable in that field.",,,
C071,喷洒泥浆,Slurry Spreader,T2,,,液肥散布機,即使在13R打出、仅靠两次收获就能启动也已经足够有效。收获后还能播种，所以园艺事务长更容易瞄准。,"In the breeding phase of each harvest, if you get newborn animals of at least two types, you also get a ""Sow"" action.",,,
C072,丰收庆计划,Harvest Festival Planning,T2,,,収穫祭計画,,"When you play this card, immediately carry out the field phase of the harvest. Afterwards, you get a ""Major or Minor Improvement"" action.",,,
C073,海藻肥,Seaweed Fertilizer,T3,,,海藻肥料,在播种玩法时是优秀的种子补助。即使在终盘只是拿到蔬菜也不算坏的效果。能拿到种子是在播下之后，所以要注意,"Each time after you take an unconditional ""Sow"" action, you get 1 grain from the general supply. From round 11 on, you can get 1 vegetable instead.",,,
C075,木柴,Firewood,T3,,,薪,如果能运用得当，就是强力的木材辅助。比较稳妥的打法是：序盘打出一边拿到炉灶一边拿木材，中盘再把它转换成炉灶调理场并再次获得木材。若已明确确定了方针，在4番手的第1手打出也不坏。,"In the returning home phase of each round, place 1 wood on this card. Each time before you build a Fireplace, Cooking Hearth, or oven, move up to 4 wood from this card to your supply.",,,
C080,岩石地形,Rocky Terrain,T3,,,岩石地帯,费用稍微有点重，但效果还算不错。用这张卡出石头的话，石头会因此变轻，所以要注意别让石头没地方用。用犁一次出多张田地的话，就会按那个数量发动。,"Each time you plow a field (tile or card), you can also buy 1 stone for 1 food.",,,
C081,建材中心,Material Hub,T4,,,資源拠点,,"Immediately place 2 of each building resource on this card. Each time any player (including you) takes at least 5 wood, 4 clay, 3 reed, or 3 stone, you get 1 of that building resource from this card.",,,
C082,五金商店,Hardware Store,T1,,,よろず屋,只要和日雇い连招扯上关系，不言而喻就很强力。单体也有使用价值。,"Each time after you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you can pay 2 food total to buy 1 wood, 1 clay, 1 reed, and 1 stone.",,,
C083,早产牛,Early Cattle,T3,,,若牛,既然出了就一定要让它繁殖。单体的话-3分有点偏重，所以不太行。和调理场成套的话，每次收获都会变成4饭。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 cattle.",,,
C084,多年生黑麦,Perennial Rye,T4,,,ライ麦飼料,家畜的配对、繁殖空间、小麦田和前期准备都很麻烦。收获前的回合无法发动，后期发动机会也少，所以有点难用。,"Each round that does not end with a harvest, you can pay 1 grain to breed exactly 1 type of animal. (This is not considered a breeding phase.)",,,
C085,小窝建造师,Den Builder,T2,,,ねぐら作り,条件也没那么苛刻，成本也很轻。即使无法产出那么多小麦，也完全值得活用。,"When you live in a clay or stone house, you can pay 1 grain and 2 food. If you do, for the rest of the game, this card provides room for exactly one person.",,,
C088,木匠学徒,Carpenter's Apprentice,T1,,,見習い大工,木屋加建2间，用15根栅栏可减7木。若加建3间或建马厩则更划算。因为是减免，所以也很高兴能和木匠、家具工匠小屋、马厩清洁工等形成配合。,Wood rooms cost you 2 woods less. Your 3rd and 4th stable each cost you 1 wood less. Your 13th to 15th fence each cost you nothing.,,,
C091,开荒英雄,Plow Hero,T2,,,耕作の英雄,虽然是锄匠的完全下位互换，但在田地负担重的场合几乎可以无差别地使用。用内地管理者等进行连续行动时，会不再是第1人，所以注意,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"" or ""Cultivation"" action space with the first person you place in a round, you can plow 1 additional field for 1 food.",,,
C092,中年母亲,Autumn Mother,T2,,,秋の母,由于食物供给也会增加，实际上需要相当于4饭的量。虽然能实现手牌压缩，但启动时机和饭效率是难点。增员进步打不出来也很难受。,"Immediately before each harvest, if you have room in your house, you can take a ""Family Growth"" action for 3 food.",,,
C093,城区总监,Inner Districts Director,T3,,,内地管理者,可以进行增筑奇袭或栅栏奇袭。尤其是在木材或栅栏很重的局面下，3木→栅栏的动作很优秀。与森林保护者的combo下，3木→SP的动作也很强力。即使人手不够，也可以放置1石。,"Each time you use the ""Forest"" or ""Clay Pit"" accumulation space, you can place 1 stone from the general supply on the other space. If you do, you can immediately place another person.",,,
C094,马厩清洁工,Stable Cleaner,T3,,,厩掃除人,即使只考虑得分效率，1木1饭换1分也算还不错。想要用得好，需要巧妙地确保繁殖空间，或者与厩系的Combo成套运用。,"At any time, you can take the ""Build Stables"" action without placing a person. If you do, each stable costs you 1 wood and 1 food.",,,
C095,箩筐编织工,Basket Weaver,T3,,,カゴ編み,如果在选牌时感觉芦苇比较轻松，就提高优先度。建筑设计图和墙匠师傅的效果也适用。,"When you play this card, immediately build the ""Basketmaker's Workshop"" major improvement for 1 stone and 1 reed.",,,
C097,种子研究员,Seed Researcher,T3,,,種子研究者,发动起来很强力，但发动机会仅限于中盘以后。自己一个人反复去拿小麦或蔬菜效率很差，所以如果可以的话，想以搭上别人的小麦连动的形式打出。,"Each time any people return from both the ""Grain Seeds"" and ""Vegetable Seeds"" action spaces, you get 2 food and you can play 1 occupation, without paying an occupation cost.",,,
C099,园林设计师,Garden Designer,T2,,,ガーデンデザイナー,无论是用调理场、烤面包还是其他方式，只要能出饭就能拿到相当可观的奖励分。要烤面包的话，与其用窑，不如在调理场把大量小麦一口气转换成饭也是很有力的选择。有调理场时，把家畜烤到各剩1头为止，然后在田里放饭。视情况而定，不必把资源全砸在这张卡上，老老实实扩展盘面，4畑4飯→大约4分妥协也足够有用。唯一的缺点是种点会变得不容易增加。,"At the start of scoring, you can place food in empty fields. You get 1/2/3 bonus points for each field in which you place 1/4/7 food.",,,
C100,男管家,Butler,T3,,,使用人頭,如果要做到6栋的话，就是优秀的得分来源。,"If you play this card in round 11 or before, during scoring, you get 4 bonus points if you then have more rooms than people.",,,
C101,摊贩,Stall Holder,T3,,,屋台の所有者,虽然需要前期准备，但有4个厩舍的话效率还算不错。如果在收获前的回合没有发动，到了收获阶段也能发动效果。,"Once per round, if you have 0/1/2/3/4 unfenced stables on your farm, you can exchange 2 grain for 1 bonus point and 1/2/3/4/5 food.",,,
C102,树木守护者,Tree Guard,T1,,,森林保護者,基本的行动是拿石窑和井。要巧妙地踩SP，想把自己放下的木头回收回来。,"Each time after you use a wood accumulation space, you can place 4 wood from your supply on that space to get 2 stone, 1 clay, 1 reed, and 1 grain.",,,
C103,蔬果商贩,Green Grocer,T4,,,青果商,2饭→小麦转换比较稳妥也好用。除此之外就看和其他卡的Combo搭配情况了。,"At the start of each round, you can make exactly one of the following exchanges: 1 Cattle → 1 Vegetable; 1 Vegetable → 1 Cattle; 2 Sheep → 1 Vegetable; 1 Vegetable → 2 Sheep; 2 Food → 1 Grain; 1 Grain → 2 Food",,,
C105,箩筐搬运工,Basket Carrier,T1,,,かご運び,只要有食料，资材效率就相当高。因为每回合都能拿到小麦，所以用烤面包来维持饮食比较稳妥。从右上角的按钮启动。不会特别显示什么提示，所以务必注意别忘了启动。,"Once each harvest, you can buy 1 wood, 1 reed, and 1 grain for 2 food total.",,,
C111,小动物饲养员,Small Animal Breeder,T4,,,小動物飼育員,初手打出，如果在第4R捡到4饭，就能一直发挥效果到第7R，所以至少能发挥6饭以上的作用。话虽如此，用掉宝贵的前期一手的价值偏低。,"Before the start of each round, if you have food equal to or higher than the current round number (e.g., 8+ food in round 8), you get 1 food.",,,
C114,土壤科学家,Soil Scientist,T3,,,土壌科学者,作为小麦补助很优秀。持续去拿粘土桩的话，会变成2小麦1砖的行动。,"Each time after you use a clay/stone accumulation space, you can place 1 stone/2 clay from your supply on the space to get 2 grain/1 vegetable, respectively.",,,
C115,播种工,Sower,T2,,,種まき人,虽然发动时机不多，但如果打算收集大进步大约3个的话，无论作为芦苇补助还是作为播种补助都还算不错。也要记住，在最后一次收获后还能播种来增加种子分。,"Each time you build a major improvement, place 1 reed from the general supply on that card. At any time, you can move the reed to your supply or exchange it for a ""Sow"" action.",,,
C117,跑腿工,Legworker,T1,,,補助作業員,,"Each time you use an action space that is orthogonally adjacent to another action space occupied by one of your people, you get 1 wood.",,,
C120,务农工人,Agricultural Labourer,T3,,,農業労働者,做2块小麦田并全部收获的话就能完全回本。直到拿到8块砖之前的时间差很大。终盘阶段砖很容易变得没用处，所以想事先确保一些用法。,"Place 8 clay on this card. For each grain you obtain, you also get 1 clay from this card.",,,
C124,石头进口商,Stone Importer,T3,,,石材輸入業者,石可以大量产出，但吃饭消耗很大。用获得的石头去搜罗大型进步吧。,"In the breeding phase of the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th/6th harvest, you can use this card to buy exactly 2 stone for 2/2/3/3/4/1 food.",,,
C125,夜班工人,Nightworker,T1,,,夜間労働者,想通过增筑、畜棚、篱笆把手头的资源用得干干净净。在BGA上也可以把手头的资源丢弃，但那样的话必须在劳动阶段开始前就先丢掉，所以要注意。如果能把木头用得恰到好处，也会与森林守护者形成强力联动。,"Before the start of each work phase, you can place a person on an accumulation space of a building resource not in your supply. (Then proceed with the start player.)",,,
C127,情圣,Lover,T1,A,,愛人,与强力的饭基盘搭配使用。即使在打出这张卡后再增筑1栋，情人也会擅自住进去，所以无法进行追加的增员。,"When you play this card, immediately pay an amount of food equal to the number of complete rounds left to play to take a ""Family Growth Even without Room"" action.",,"Lover Extra cost: 4 food Ah, the infamous lover. Certainly, in reports like this tournament thread tournament thread ,
he seems to be unfair. In the game, a player plays turn 2 lover and is able to
seemingly coast to victory. Without a doubt, the Lover is one of the best
occupations in the game. But is he broken? Playing the lover is pretty much impossible on round 1, so by 'early lover
action,' people generally mean rounds 2, 3 or 4, with the most infamous starts
coming in round 2. If you play it round 2, you're going to need to take
day-laborer once just to play it. Afterwards, you'll have either 1 or 0 food
and will need to secure 6 food by the end of the harvest. This should take at
least 2 more actions. What does this mean? You've spent 4 actions to get 2
actions before the first harvest! Another weakness with the Early Lover is that his house is still 2 rooms! A
player who grows his family the old fashioned way has the option of building a
4th room to his house and growing again. On the other hand, the Early Lover is
stuck with his 2 room house - he's going to need 10 wood and 4 reed before he
can grow his family again. If he decides to eschew further 'fair' family growth
and wait for 'Family Growth without Room,' he suffers from the fact that his 2
room house is pretty much unsuitable for renovation - there just won't be many
points in it. The final weakness is that playing the Lover early puts a giant bulls-eye on
your head. If your opponents are strong, they will be looking to screw you out
of food at every possible avenue. That said, what makes the Early Lover strong is that while he is scrambling for
food, he is also using his extra actions to take resources off of the board.
The result is that while his farm might not look all that impressive, no one
else's will either! Pretty much everyone will be gimped by the Lover's
inefficient scrambling, and by the end the Lover himself usually comes out
ahead. Playing the Lover on turn 2 is an all-in play - you are either going to win
because of the play or lose because of it. An interesting alternative is to
forgo playing him until around stage 3. Usually by this time, you have grown
your family once and have some sort of a food engine up. Hopefully, you can
then grab either 3 sheep or a piled fishing spot and use it to play the card.
Used this way, the Lover is safer and still a strong play, but doesn't have the
swingy potential that playing him early does.",
C129,二婚配偶,Second Spouse,T2,,,二人目の配偶者,即使把这张卡打出来，也很少有那种需要急着去「想要孩子」的场面。如果除了自己以外的人都已经是五口之家，那就是多余的累赘。,"You can use the ""Urgent Wish for Children"" action space (from round 12-13) even if it is occupied by the first person another player placed.",,,
C130,郊区总监,Outskirts Director,T3,,,郊外指導者,与效果相近的内地管理人相比，因为并不是每回合都想去两个空间，所以显得稍逊一筹。多次启动的话，葦会一下子变得轻松。即使家族不富余，也可以放置2葦。,"Each time you use the ""Grove"" or ""Hollow"" accumulation space, you can place 2 reed from the general supply on the other space. If you do, you can immediately place another person.",,,
C131,私人教师,Private Teacher,T2,,,個人教師,偏强的小麦·职业补助。可发动的时机依赖他人，在职业经常空着的中盘以后会变得稍微难发动。其他玩家打出在职业格以外出职业的牌（如乞讨的学生或教师桌）也会减少发动机会，这也是缺点。小麦0、已打出烤面包棒的状态下即使启动私人教师，也烤不了小麦（先烤面包）。,"Each time you use the ""Grain Seeds"" action space when any ""Lessons"" action space is occupied, you can also play an occupation for an occupation cost of 1 food.",,,
C132,木瓦制造商,Timber Shingle Maker,T3,,,こけら葺き職人,5木能变成5分，是很优秀的得分效率。话虽如此，需要在改建前先把这张卡打出，并准备好木材，所以前期准备会很忙。如果拉不出足够的栅栏就本末倒置了，因此有木材补助的话会很开心。,"When you renovate to stone, you can place up to 1 wood from your supply in each of your rooms. During scoring, each such wood is worth 1 bonus point.",,,
C133,士兵,Soldier,T3,,,兵士,得分效率还算可以。如果有横切的木材就会非常强力。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each stone-wood pair in your supply. You cannot score additional points for the resources scored with this card.",,,
C134,牧牛贵族,Cow Prince,T1,,,牛の王子,有牛的地块每格1分。拉一圈较大的栅栏，在第4阶段去“家畜市场”或“牛1”两次，建立繁殖体制吧。栅栏外的厩舍或房子里饲养的牛也算分。用调教师时也按每一栋计数。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each space in your farmyard (including rooms) holding at least 1 cattle.",,,
C136,大牧场看守,Ranch Provost,T2,,,牧場長,参考一个牧场内可饲养数量。,"If there are still 3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with a pasture of highest capacity gets 3 bonus points.",,,
C138,动物喂养员,Animal Feeder,T3,,,家畜餌やり,单独使用的话有点火力不足。想把它加入日雇组合技里。,"On the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you also get your choice of 1 sheep or 1 grain. Instead of that good, you can buy 1 wild boar for 1 food or 1 cattle for 2 food.",,,
C139,边筐工妻子,Basketmaker's Wife,T2,,,籠造りの妻,芦苇较轻的场地里会大显身手。别名森林评论家的妻子,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 reed and 1 food. At any time, you can turn 1 reed into 2 food.",,,
C140,包装艺术家,Packaging Artist,T3,,,包装の達人,效果虽然有限，但打出时能获得1小麦，因此至少能发挥最低限的作用。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 grain. Each time you get a ""Minor Improvement"" action, you can take a ""Bake Bread"" action instead.",,,
C141,羊只供应商,Sheep Provider,T2,,,羊の世話人,如果只有1名玩家拥有灶台厨房，发动机会就会减少。自己拿灶台厨房也是一种选择。有爱动物者或牧畜追赶者的话会更容易起动。终盘即使是2羊也经常会被拿走，所以更容易起动。,"Each time any player (including you) uses the ""Sheep Market"" accumulation space, you get 1 grain.",,,
C143,石头采购商,Stone Buyer,T3,D,,石買い付け人,加上职业成本的话，可以用1步花4饭获得3石。稍微有点重。,"When you play this card, you can immediately buy exactly 2 stone for 1 food. From the next round on, one per round, you can buy 1 stone for 2 food.",,"Stone Buyer This is the most tempting resource buyer to play, simply because stone is the
most valuable resource in the game. Still, in order for him to be worth it,
you're going to need a good early source of food to take advantage of the
people using the RSF spot. You're also going to need a way to use that stone in
the early game. Usually, he doesn't seem worth it.",
C145,森林审查员,Forest Reviewer,T1,,,森林評論家,可以大量获得芦苇。如果有空的2木“小森林”，就自己去，占点以争取早期增筑的动き很优秀。,"Each time after any player (including you) uses the unoccupied ""Grove"" or ""Forest"" accumulation space while the other of the two is occupied, you get 1 reed.",,,
C146,工坊助理,Workshop Assistant,T2,,,工房の助手,,"Place a unique pair of different building resources on each of your improvements. Each time another player renovates, you may move one such pair to your supply.",,,
C148,泥坑挖掘工,Mud Wallower,T1,,,泥だらけの入居者,如果和厨房搭配运用，就能成为相当稳固的食物基盘。若能在每个回合各发动一次效果，再加上繁殖分，总计可获得11头野猪。获得时若不把野猪放在这张卡上，收容量就不会增加，需要特别注意。,"Each time you use an accumulation space, place 1 clay from the general supply on this card. You must immediately exchange 4 clay on this card for 1 wild boar, held by this card.",,,
C150,鹦鹉饲养员,Parrot Breeder,T2,,,オウムブリーダー,为了打出这张卡，甚至要花1次行动和1小麦也要去做的行动似乎不多。能发挥效果的时机也不稳定，很难用。,"On your turn, if you pay 1 grain to the general supply, you can use the same action space that the player to your right has just used on their turn.",,,
C151,播种总监,Sowing Director,T3,,,種まきの指導者,终盘输2次就有足够的效果。有耕耘机等农田辅助的话更容易发挥。,"Each time after another player uses the ""Grain Utilization"" action space, you get a ""Sow"" action.",,,
C154,双胞胎研究员,Twin Researcher,T3,,,双子の研究者,分数的转换效率不差，但很难稳定触发。可以用木、砖、石、食物来触发。既然出了就想至少触发4次以上。用伐木工多次进入2木或3木大概是最好的用法。,"Each time you use one of the two accumulation spaces for the same type of good containing exactly the same number of goods, you can also buy 1 bonus point for 1 food.",,,
C155,食品分配员,Food Distributor,T2,,,食料供給人,行动空间卡是指在1R～14R翻开的卡。若在中盘以后，通常经常能出到8饭左右。也能拿到小麦，所以很多情况下都是出它稳赚。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 grain and, at the start of this returning home phase, an amount of food equal to the number of occupied action space cards.",,,
C156,牛蹄护理工,Hoof Caregiver,T3,,,削蹄師,大致是2小麦2饭的效果。能和投绳连动。在牛被占走的状态下拿SP并打出这张卡的话，下回合可以去2牛。,"Immediately add 1 cattle from the general supply to the ""Cattle Market"" accumulation space. Afterward, you get 1 grain plus 1 food for each cattle on ""Cattle Market"".",,,
C157,原料分析师,Resource Analyzer,T4,,,資源分析者,发动条件不太稳定，得到的却只有食料。,"Before the start of each round, if you have more building resources than all other players of at least two types, you get 1 food.",,,
C158,森林宣传员,Forest Campaigner,T3,,,森林活動家,如果没有像「森の宿屋」或「森林所有者」这类木补助，或者像「森林保護者」这类放置木头的卡牌，发动机会就会相当少。,"Each time before you place a person, if there are at least 8 wood total on accumulation spaces, you get 1 food.",,,
C159,渔夫之友,Fisherman's Friend,T2,,,漁師の友人,有“捕鱼连招”的玩家在场的话就更容易发挥。顺利的话每回合都能获得大量的饭。不过相当依赖别人，有点不稳定。注意发动时机是在回合开始时。,"At the start of each round, if there is more food on the ""Traveling Players"" than on the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, you get the difference from the general supply.",,,
C160,先驱者,Outrider,T4,C,,先行騎手,相当不稳定。刚出来就去拿石1或猪1的走法有点微妙。因为在行动前能拿到小麦，所以能用“畑種”播下小麦很开心。,"Each time before you use the action space on the most recently revealed action space card (after it has been placed on the round space), you get 1 grain.",,"Outrider In my opinion this is one of the coolest occupations in the deck, even if he's
nowhere near the most powerful. If you're planning on baking, you can use him
to give you nice bonuses with the grain that you were otherwise going to spend
an action on. Later, when you (hopefully) are taking Family Growth, Family
Growth Without Room and Plow and/or Sow as they come out, you'll get an
additional bonus. At the end of the game, if you've gotten 3 grain out of him, he was probably
worth the action.",
C161,土豆挖掘工,Potato Digger,T3,,,じゃがいも掘り,耕运锄等强力的田地辅助配合一起使用吧。要是有施纳普斯制造者之类能活用收获蔬菜的卡牌，那就无可挑剔了。,"When you play this card, if you have at least 2/4/5 unplanted field tiles, you immediately get 1/2/3 vegetables.",,,
C162,森林主人,Forest Owner,T3,,,森林所有者,整个游戏中可获得的木材会一下子变多。因为优秀的行动格子变多了，回合数多的人更容易占优势。如果自己行动次数少，最好别出。,"This card is an action space for all. If another player uses it, they get 3 wood and must give you 1 wood from the general supply. If you use it, you get 4 wood.",,,
C163,物料派送工,Material Deliveryman,T3,,,素材運び,整体上在食物较轻的场合，渔业或小剧场里更容易攒饭，所以发动机会会增加。有森林保护者的话效果相当显著。,"Each time any player (including you) takes 5/6/7/8+ goods from an accumulation space, you get 1 wood/clay/reed/stone from the general supply.",,,
C164,德国牧草看守者,German Heath Keeper,T2,,,黒羊使い,终盘经常会被1猪也上，所以尤其在终盘触发机会会增加。还算不错的羊辅助,"Each time any player (including you) uses the ""Pig Market"" accumulation space, you get 1 sheep from the general supply.",,,
C168,动物猎人,Animal Catcher,T2,,,動物捕り,即使没有日雇组合，也可以先围上栅栏，终盘再打出，通过拿家畜套装的打法就足够强。有调理场的话，可以把获得的家畜烤了用来抵支付食料的成本。如果没有调理场还想从中盘开始用，食料消耗会相当猛烈，需要注意。,"Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, instead of 2 food, you can get 3 different animals from the general supply. If you do, you must pay 1 food each harvest left to play.",,,
D001,Z形耙,Zigzag Harrow,T2,,,ジグザグ鍬,只要有一部分是L字型，即使还有其他田地也能发动效果。比如，即使田地已经被耕成2×2格的状态，也可以用这张卡耕田。,"You can immediately plow 1 field such that it completes a ""zigzag"" pattern.",,,
D002,宅地规划,Dwelling Plan,T2,,,住居計画,用于砖房增建、石屋Combo，以及防止改建事故,"You can immediately take a ""Renovation"" action.",,,
D003,犁沟,Furrows,T3,,,あぜの溝,在序盘准备好1田地1小麦后使用这张卡，后半就更容易进行活用小麦的行动。,You can immediately sow in exactly 1 field.,,,
D005,田间黏土,Field Clay,T3,,,畑の粘土,如果是小麦流，可以一口气确保用于扩建或改建的砖块。也可以在终盘打出，用来确保制陶所得分用的砖块。像豆田或田地看护人那样，作为田地的卡也会被计入。,You immediately get 1 clay for each planted field you have.,,,
D006,硅化木,Petrified Wood,T3,,,珪化木,在木头轻而石头重的场中,Immediately exchange up to 3 wood for 1 stone each.,,,
D008,蕨类种子,Fern Seeds,T3,,,シダの胞子,条件很苛刻，但效果很优秀。注意要多去农田。,"You get 2 food and 1 grain, which you must sow immediately.",,,
D011,草场肥料,Lawn Fertilizer,T3,,,芝生用肥料,仅限1格牧场的效果。在7根2格牧场中可以进行2种繁殖。,"Your pastures of size 1 can hold up to 3 animals of the same type. (With a stable, they can hold up to 6 animals of the same type.)",,,
D013,泥铲,Trowel,T2,,,こて,不消耗回合进行改建。防止改建事故+1并减少1手。也可以活用各种改建辅助卡的效果。与熟练改建屋联动。,"At any time, you can renovate your house to stone. From a wooden house, this costs 1 stone, 1 reed, and 1 food per room. From a clay house, this costs 1 stone per room.",,,
D014,碎石锤,Hammer Crusher,T2,,,ハンマー破砕機,,"Immediately before you renovate to stone, you get 2 clay and 1 reed and you can take a ""Build Rooms"" action.",,,
D016,木质乳清桶,Wooden Whey Bucket,T2,,,木製ホエイ桶,一边获取家畜，一边也能争取确保繁殖空间。即使只考虑建厩的得分效率，也有相当不错的效果。就算没有饲养家畜的空间，也能立刻把拿到的家畜养在建好的厩里。,"Each time before you use the ""Sheep Market""/""Cattle Market"" accumulation space, you can build exactly 1 stable for 1 wood/at no cost.",,,
D017,播种耙,Drill Harrow,T3,,,ドリル鍬,只要饭基盘能稳住，这是一张相当强力的田地辅助。可以通过「穀物活用」一边耕田一边播种，或者用「耕作」一次耕两块田。,"Each time before you take an unconditional ""Sow"" action, you can pay 3 food to plow 1 field.",,,
D018,蒸汽动力犁,Steam Plow,T2,,,蒸気鋤,着眼于最终盘面，确保能及时发动。木辅助最好多准备一些。,"Immediately after each returning home phase, you can pay 2 wood and 1 food to use the ""Farmland"" action space without placing a person.",,,
D019,碎土犁,Pulverizer Plow,T1,,,粉砕鋤,农田变成了次要行动，不知为何还会额外白送砖块。即使不是砖块系连招，单卡也足够强力。像制陶所之类的，要先确保拿到的砖块有用武之地。,"Immediately after each time you use a clay accumulation space, you can pay 1 clay to plow 1 field. If you do, place that 1 clay on the accumulation space.",,,
D021,发展人口,Recruitment,T1,,,男児求む,能够增员这一点很强力，但考虑到要打出这张卡或去踩小进步的行动，其实也未必能获得那么大的手收益。自己用这张卡增员的份，也会让其他人更容易增员，这一点也算是小缺点。在打出这张卡的状态下增筑2间房，然后通过增员进步一口气增员2人，这种运用方式看起来通用性很高。,"Provided you have room in your house, each time you get a ""Minor Improvement"" action, you can take a ""Family Growth"" action instead.",,,
D022,工作许可证,Work Permit,T2,,,労働許可証,可以留到将来的一手来用。库存中的人物如果是第5人，就无法再增加第5人了，所以要注意。,"Add 1 to the current round for each building resource you have and place 1 person from your supply on the corresponding round space. In that round, you can use the person.",,,
D023,先驱精神,Pioneering Spirit,T4,,,開拓者の魂,虽然活跃机会有限，但如果无论如何都想进行早期改筑，或想进行蔬菜系的连携时就派上吧。,"This card is an action space for you only. In rounds 3-5, it provides a ""renovation"" action. In rounds 6-8, it provides your choice of 1 vegetable, wild boar, or cattle.",,,
D024,兄弟情深,Brotherly Love,T4,,,兄弟愛,这张卡还不至于为了它去走4人进程，但如果看起来会走4人进程的话就想打出这张卡。有日雇组合或动物爱好者时，能去同一个格子很开心,"As long as you have exactly 4 people, in the work phase of each round, you can place your third and fourth person immediately after one another, even on the same action space.",,,
D025,,Witches' Dance Floor,,,,魔女の踊り場,,"This card is a field that you can sow in, an occupation, and the ""Fireplace"" major improvement with all of its effects. You can play it only via a ""Minor Improvement"" action.",,,
D026,木匠庭院,Carpenter's Yard,T3,,,大工の敷地,成本很重但效果却很有限，不太好发挥。,"You can build the ""Joinery"" and ""Well"" major improvement even when taking a ""Minor Improvement"" action, or you can build both with a single ""Major Improvement"" action.",,,
D027,转职培训,Retraining,T2,,,再教育,大体是1饭1点卡。交换与获得不同，所以工艺指南的效果不会发动。,"At the end of each turn in which you renovate, you can exchange your Joinery for the Pottery or your Pottery for the Basketmaker's Workshop.",,,
D030,工匠街区,Artisan District,T2,,,職人地区,虽然很浪漫，但要刻意拿到3个以上相当困难。建议和建筑设计图或强力的石头辅助搭配运用。也可以作为1石1分卡来用。,"During scoring, you get 2/5/8 bonus points for having 3/4/5 major improvements from the bottom row of the supply board.",,,
D031,存储室,Storeroom,T2,,,貯蔵部屋,相对于成本，原本的VP偏低。3小麦3蔬菜奖励2分，5小麦5蔬菜则为3分,"During scoring, you get 1/2 bonus point for each pair of grain plus vegetable you have (considering all crops in your supply and fields), rounded up.",,,
D032,木质耙子,Wood Rake,T2,,,木のくまで,拥有4~5块田地并且能在最终回合播种的话，大多就能满足条件。1木2分。像豆田或田地看护人那样作为田地的卡牌也要计入。,"During scoring, if you had at least 7 goods in your fields before the final harvest, you get 2 bonus points.",,,
D033,避暑宅院,Summer House,T2,,,避暑地の別荘,在中段笔直建2、3间是基本。举例来说，4间3田2格7根牧场比较稳妥（田和栅栏摆成“コ”字形）。成本偏高，需要在改建前打出，木头用得太多会变得不好行动，所以要注意。因为不用在盘面上花太多功夫，想去收集盘外点数。,"During scoring, if you live in a stone house, you get 2 bonus points for each unused farmyard space orthogonally adjacent to your house. (You still lose the points for these unused spaces.)",,,
D034,奢华旅店,Luxurious Hostel,T3,,,豪華な宿泊所,可瞄准的场面不多，但得分效率是◎,"During scoring, if you then have more stone rooms than people, you get 4 bonus points. You can only use one card to get bonus points for your stone house.",,,
D035,饲料室,Fodder Chamber,T2,,,飼料部屋,虽然成本相当沉重，但效果很强力。尽早建立小麦量产体制和繁殖体制，争取以4点=12只以上为目标。,"During scoring in a game with 1/2/3/4+ players, you get 1 bonus point for every 7th/5th/4th/3rd animal on your farm.",,,
D036,繁殖登记簿,Breed Registry,T2,,,品種登録,不做成吉思汗就有3分。可以抓2只羊来繁殖，也可以在终盘只抓1只。也不需要成本，是一张通用性非常高的奖励分卡。,"During scoring, if you gained at most 2 sheep from sources other than breeding during the game and have not turned any sheep into food, you get 3 bonus points.",,,
D040,污水坑,Cesspit,T1,,,汚水だめ,从起手开始走“职业田地→田地SP污水池不行→砖4厨房”这一流程是基本手顺。有能活用田地的卡的话，就能弥补田地的手亏，变得更强力。,"Alternate placing 1 clay and 1 wild boar on each remaining round space, starting with clay. At the start of these rounds, you get the respective good.",,,
D044,林中水井,Forest Well,T2,,,森の井戸,在增建两间木屋之前，用SP来打会很强力。即使只有5饭左右也足够。,"Place 1 food on each remaining round space, up to the amount of wood in your supply. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
D046,压纹机,Pellet Press,T3,,,ペレット圧縮機,假设吃掉3个芦苇，那么合计资源砖2+芦苇3为12饭。由于还有职业条件以及获得饭之前的时间差，所以有点不好用。,"Once per round, you can pay 1 reed. If you do, place 1 food on each of the next 4 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
D047,教堂墓地,Churchyard,T3,,,教会墓地,和职业或进步系卡牌成套。有接单生产工匠或教育桌的话就更好了。,"Place 2 food on each remaining round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the food. (*Occupations and Improvements)",,,
D048,市政立绘,Civic Facade,T3,,,市民のはりぼて,出很多进步的话就吃饭。看手牌情况。3间房时打出的话，之后即使增筑效果也会生效。,"Before the start of each round, if you have more occupations than improvements in your hand, you get 1 food.",,,
D051,拱门,Archway,T3,,,アーチ道,在出职业之前必须先出，但打出的人除了胜利点之外没有任何好处，这点很难受。和砍柴联动。,"This card is an action space for all. A player who uses it immediately gets 1 food. Immediately before the returning home phase, they can use an unoccupied action space with the person from this card.",,,
D052,擀面杖,Rolling Pin,T3,,,麺棒,如果勤快地去篱笆的话，就能增加触发机会。在BGA上也要姑且记得可以丢弃任意资源这一点。如果有踩泥土和砖补助的话，中盘以后就能减少进木的机会，从而增加触发机会。,"In the returning home phase of each round, if you have more clay than wood in your supply, you get 1 food.",,,
D053,茶馆,Tea House,T2,,,喫茶店,跳过第二个家族以获得食物的效果有点难以发挥，但如果能作为2分卡使用就足够了。,"Once per round, you can skip placing your second person and get 1 food instead. (You can place the person later that round.)",,,就是二分卡，没啥好说的。比较优质的二分卡的。这个打打出来一定是后期打的，就是前期打出来获取食物的话，第二个往往会年轻人，我觉得损失是有点大的。你在二三期的话，第二个娃，然后就因为每一次开一个食物，其实都就只有一季的一个食物是价值比较高的。从第三集开始，这个食物肯定不值得你的第二个娃娃后一点，他就是当做一张两分传递的。
D054,鳟鱼池,Trout Pool,T3,,,マスの池,如果没人去2饭，就能拿到饭。如果没有渔业combo，发动机会比较多，效果还算不错。回合开始时的处理顺序是先补充饭→再开始劳动阶段，按这个顺序。,"At the start of each work phase, if there are at least 3 food on the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, you get 1 food from the general supply.",,,
D055,新市场,New Market,T3,,,新しい市場,対象行动是猪蔬菜牛石。相较于成本效果偏弱，而且只能从中盘开始发动。能让东西的采石场实现差别化的卡牌。,"Each time you use an action space card on round spaces 8 to 11, you get 1 additional food.",,,
D056,肥畜屠宰架,Fatstock Stretcher,T2,,,屠畜場,虽然仅限于灶台厨房，但这是非常优秀的饭类辅助。即使一次烤制多个，也能按相应数量获得食料。,"Each time you turn a sheep or wild boar into food using a cooking improvement, you get 1 additional food.",,,
D057,批发市场,Wholesale Market,T3,,,卸売市場,由于成本大概相当于3点以上，所以如果不是蔬菜大量出现的盘面，打出来的意义就不大。,"Place 1 food on each remaining round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
D058,撒布机,Gritter,T4,,,種子散布機,大多就算努力也就3～4饭左右，稍微有点不够。只种小麦的情况下，即使原本有蔬菜田也不会发动。,"At the end of each action in which you sow vegetables in a field, you get 1 food for each vegetable field you have (including the new ones).",,,
D059,土造烤炉,Earth Oven,T1,,,掘り土窯,可获得2点额外分数的烤炉。注意：不能从厨房进行转换。,"At any time: Vegetable → 3 Food; Sheep → 2 Food; Wild boar → 3 Food; Cattle → 3 Food ""Bake Bread"" action: Grain → 2 Food",,,
D060,大陶艺工坊,Large Pottery,T3,,,大製陶所,如果能通过粘土层的洼地或再生砖等大量产出砖块的话，这是非常优秀的效果。,At any time: Clay → 2 Food Scoring: 3/5/6/7 Clay → 1/2/3/4 bonus points,,,
D061,稻草垛,Bale of Straw,T3,,,わらのたわら,如果手牌能大量利用小麦，那就从序中盘开始活用吧。作为终盘的饭补助也还算不错,"At the start of each harvest, if you have at least 3 grain fields (including field cards with planted grain), you get 2 food.",,,
D062,桶装啤酒,Beer Tap,T3,,,ビールタップ,和窑相比效率相当差，但1木2饭勉强能避免赤字。如果能出大量小麦就能成为饭基盘，但如果能拿到窑就用那边来吃饭。姑且像6小麦12饭这样，一次收获也能多次启动。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 food. In the feeding phase of each harvest, you can turn 2/3/4 grain into 3/6/9 food.",,,
D063,田埂坎,Lynchet,T3,,,段地,在家旁边建造2块小麦田，每次收获可获得2饭。从序盘开始建小麦田的话效果还算不错。也可以用来在终盘补足略微不足的饭。,"In the field phase of each harvest, you get 1 food for each harvested field tile that is orthogonally adjacent to your house.",,,
D064,烘焙课程,Baking Course,T2,,,焼き菓子教室,还算可以的烤面包辅助。单体也能烤面包，所以在拿到窑之前可以用来过渡，但几乎和生吃没什么区别。,"At the end of each round that does not end with a harvest, you can take a ""Bake Bread"" action. ""Bake Bread"" action: Grain → 2 Food",,,
D065,谷物筛子,Grain Sieve,T3,,,麦ふるい,与使用小麦能发挥优秀效果的卡片搭配使用吧。,"In the field phase of each harvest, if you harvest at least 2 grain, you get 1 additional grain from the general supply.",,,
D067,钩状镰刀,Reap Hook,T2,,,刈り取りフック,第1个先拿伦窑来烤，然后第2个第3个用种パン做到1まき1パン之类的，就会很强力,"Place 1 grain on each of the next 3 of the round spaces 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14. At the start of these rounds, you get the grain.",,,
D068,小篮子,Small Basket,T3,,,小さなカゴ,可以不勉强地获得那些高效获取手段较少的蔬菜。在葦子较重的局面里，葦2很容易被拿走，所以不太好发挥。,"Each time you use the ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you can pay 1 reed to get 1 vegetable. If you do in a game with 4+ players, place that 1 reed on the accumulation space.",,,
D070,Straw Manure,Straw Manure,T4,,,わら肥料,因为很少会有想要5个以上蔬菜的场面，所以不能说是很强力的效果。想要和能有效利用增加的蔬菜的卡（例如曼陀林或杜松子酒等）搭配使用。,"Before the field phase of each harvest, you can pay 1 grain from your supply to add 1 vegetable to each of up to 2 vegetable fields.",,,
D071,更换作物,Changeover,T3,,,植え替え,因为会丢弃1个，所以不太适合用来增加种子。相性好的combo也比较少。,"At any time, if a field contains exactly 1 good as a result of a harvest, you can discard that good and immediately take a ""Sow"" action limited to that field.",,,"效果：更换作物
强度：通常来讲收益在一分，很少有其他的效果。毕竟弃掉一个旧物，这个损失挺大的。一般就发作一次，发动四的话，你更换掉三个麦田，就是可以获得01:05分的收益，这就是它的效果。不过一般来讲是在单卡，基本上是当一份白板用。有国外的话，他就是还能额外这个抢一下那个园林、绿化之类的。都是绿化园林，还有菜最多之类的东西，你可以在最后一集做一个突袭。总体强度比浓度偏强，但是在一分白板的这个位置。"
D072,马厩肥料,Stable Manure,T3,,,厩肥,除了序盘以外很难打出，而且启动条件也很麻烦，打出后也无法立刻发挥效果。效果也很不起眼。,"In the field phase of each harvest, you can harvest 1 additional good from a number of fields equal to the number of unfenced stables you have.",,,
D074,皇家木料,Royal Wood,T0,,,王家の木材,可以在木屋增筑或马厩、耕运犁或家具制作所等处发动效果。打出进步时如果用走私品额外支付了木头也会返还，因此相性很好。并不具有减轻成本的效果，所以在木材作为资源不足的情况下无法打出进步。,"At the end of each turn in which you use the ""Farm Expansion"" action space or build an improvement, you get 1 wood back for every 2 wood paid during those actions (rounded down).",,,
D076,社会福利,Social Benefits,T3,,,生活保護,序盘想打出，但芦苇1太沉。在BGA上要记得可以丢弃食料,"Immediately after the feeding phase of each harvest, if you have no food left, you get 1 wood and 1 clay.",,,
D080,砖锤,Brick Hammer,T3,,,レンガハンマー,能发动2次左右就已经足够强了。由于小进或灶台→厨房转换也会触发，因此根据手牌情况会成为有力的选择。,"Each time after you build an improvement costing at least 2 clay, you get 1 stone.",,,
D081,屋顶梯子,Roof Ladder,T2,,,屋根梯子,改建的芦苇将不再需要。,"Each time you renovate, you pay 1 fewer reed and, at the end of the action, you get 1 stone.",,,
D083,猪食,Pigswill,T3,,,残飯,如果可以的话想启动2次。为了在拉栅栏之前获得野猪，如果事先没有准备好能饲养的空间就无法饲养野猪，这点稍微有些缺点。,"Each time you use the ""Fencing"" action space, you also get 1 wild boar.",,,
D085,读书人,Reader,T2,,,読書家,Draft Variant是进行Draft的规则。职业系Combo专用卡。,"As soon as you have 6 occupations in front of you (including this one), this cards provides room for one person. In the draft variant, you need 7 occupations to play this.",,,
D086,小羊代养员,Sheep Agent,T4,,,羊仲介者,宠物经纪人的下位互换。想捡到成吉思汗并用于繁殖,"You can keep 1 sheep on each occupation card in front of you (including this one), unless it is already able to hold animals.",,,
D092,儿童监护员,Child Ombudsman,T1,,,児童相談員,如果增筑3间房，扣除打出这张卡所消耗的1个行动，相当于行动数增加2次，但会少6分。负分相当大，所以要确保能打出至少超过减少的6分的上限分。即使增筑多间房，每个行动都能增员也不坏。有书斋的话就能覆盖负分，非常契合。,"From round 5 on, if you have room in your house, at the end of each person action, you can take a ""Family Growth"" action with that person. If you do, you get 2 negative points.",,,
D093,羊群巡查员,Sheep Inspector,T2,,,羊調査員,,"Once per work phase, after you complete a person action, you can pay 1 sheep and 2 food to return another person you placed home.",,,
D094,怕老婆的丈夫,Henpecked Husband,T2,,,恐妻家,如果增筑3次就能赚2手，但增员很容易拥挤，所以要巧妙触发的话操作很难。即使是日雇农夫也能启动效果。,"Each time you take a ""Build Rooms"" action with the second person you place, return the first person you placed home, unless it is on the ""Meeting Place"" action space.",,,
D095,站点管理员,Site Manager,T2,,,現場監督,可以拿到像调理场、砖窑等作为“饭”基础关键的进步，也可以用2石2饭拿井。配合场上的轻量资源去拿工艺也是一招。泛用性非常高。,"When you play this card, immediately build a major improvement. When paying its cost, you can replace up to 1 building resource of each type with 1 food each.",,,
D099,陶器制作工,Earthenware Potter,T3,,,土器作り,虽然是宝贵的第1阶段的一手，但得分效率很优秀。砖在终盘用处不大，所以取5个左右也不勉强。即使没有足够家族份的砖，也可以转换任意数量的砖。,"If you play this card in round 4 or before, after the final harvest, you get 1 bonus point for each person for which you then pay 1 clay.",,,
D100,庄园领主,Lord of the Manor,T2,C,,君主,田地、栅栏、畜栏、两种种子、三种家畜最多8分。如果能在版面上顺利扩大再生产，自然就能提高分数。没有田地补助的话，种子分也很难拿到，分数就会一下子变得难以提升。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each scoring category in which you score the maximum 4 points. (The bonus point is also awarded for 4 fenced stables.)",,"Lord of the Manor Keep in mind that Agricola tends to reward people who don't focus on maxing
specific areas, and instead rewards last-minute diversification. As a result
you generally won't have much incentive for maxing areas with the intention of
getting points on this guy, because you could probably be getting just as many
points by filling in negatives. That said, you only really need 3 areas maxed for him to be worth the action.
This is most easily done with Fields, Grain, and Veggies, for obvious reasons.
If you've been able to do this, by all means play him.",
D102,样板马厩建造工,Sample Stable Maker,T2,,,厩の見本作り,实际上是把1木转换成1小麦1饭1进步，所以即便单体效果也不差。可以多次发动给饲柵栏或厩的木、家畜的照料人等效果。有厩扫除人就会变得很夸张。不过要注意，即使在1R中分多次建厩，厩的木也只会发动1次。,"At the start of each returning home phase, you can return a built stable to your supply to get 1 wood, 1 grain, 1 food, and a ""Minor Improvement"" action.",,,
D103,运河船夫,Canal Boatman,T4,,,運河の船頭,不仅难以发动，而且考虑到出牌回合的话，至少得去两次才回本。为什么有必要付饭呢。,"Each time you use ""Fishing"" or ""Reed Bank"", you can pay 1 food to immediately place another person on this card. If you do, you get your choice of 3 stone or 1 grain plus 1 vegetable.",,,
D105,雕刻师,Sculptor,T3,,,彫師,去砖头和石头那里，通过烤面包来吃吧。,"Each time you use a clay accumulation space, you also get 1 food. Each time you use a stone accumulation space, you also get 1 grain.",,,
D106,威士忌蒸馏师,Whisky Distiller,T3,,,ウイスキー蒸留器,只要有这个和小麦补助，就能保障食料。想不拿窯，而是把原本为了拿窯所要花的手数用来做别的行动。可以在收获的田地阶段后这个时机进行支付小麦的动作，并且在4R结束时的收获里支付小麦的话，6R就会有饭甩出来。这是使用这张卡时的超重要技巧。,"At any time, you can pay 1 grain. If you do, add 2 to the current round and place 4 food on the corresponding round space. At the start of that round, you get the food.",,,
D109,播种大师,Sowing Master,T4,,,種まき指導者,通过“谷物活用”和“耕作”发动。播种4次得8饭。作为前期打出的话效果稍微有点不够。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 wood. Each time after you use an action space with the ""Sow"" action, you get 2 food.",,,
D110,渔农,Fish Farmer,T3,,,養魚家,如果能顺利启动就很强力，但对他人的依赖也很大，有点难。要是在森林里能多次拿到3木2饭就非常优秀。芦原・粘土杭分别必须刚好是1 / 2饭时才会发动。,"Each time there is 1/2/3+ food on the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, you get an additional 2 food on the ""Reed Bank""/ ""Clay Pit""/ ""Grove"" accumulation spaces.",,,
D112,年幼的农夫,Young Farmer,T1,,,若い農夫,小麦和播种成套附带很优秀。和耕地补助或烤面包补助成套运用吧。因为会按“获得小麦→进步→播种”的顺序发动，所以就算拿窑，也能把得到的小麦拿去烤。,"Each time you use the ""Major Improvement"" action space, you also get 1 grain and, afterward, you can take a ""Sow"" action.",,,
D113,食品商人,Food Merchant,T3,,,食料商人,虽然会成为拿取蔬菜的手牌压缩，但小麦田或吃饭消耗等难点也很多，如果有利用小麦田的手段，或者有人参博物馆级别的蔬菜利用方法，就能成为选项。,"For each grain you harvest from a field, you can buy 1 vegetable for 3 food. If you harvest the last grain from a field, the vegetable costs you only 2 food.",,,
D116,树木巡查员,Tree Inspector,T4,,,樹木検査人,虽然不稳定，但只要运气好就是相当不错的木材辅助。有了森林保护者的话，每回合就只有自己能一直走下去。,"This card is a ""1 Wood"" accumulation space for you only. Each time the newly revealed action space card is a ""Quarry"" accumulation space, you must discard all wood from this card.",,,
D123,翻修筹划师,Renovation Preparer,T3,,,改築準備,如果做到5栋的话总共能拿到6资材，所以还算不错，但时间延迟很大。像砖增筑Combo之类，在大量增筑的情况下才能发挥真正价值。,"For each new wood/clay room you build, you get 2 clay/2 stone.",,,
D124,密使,Emissary,T3,,,使者,成本较重，但能产出相当数量的石头。Draft里如果看见了，就要记在心里，避免被其他玩家打出来后，自己在改筑时翻车。,"At any time, you can place a good from your supply on this card to get 1 stone. You must place different goods on this card. (Food is also considered a good.)",,,
D125,森林交易员,Forest Trader,T3,,,森林交易人,前期能买到芦苇很强，但食料往往会变得紧张，所以要注意。中盘等饭基盘稳定下来后再用也同样很强力。,"Each time you use a wood or clay accumulation space, you can also buy exactly 1 building resource. Wood, clay, and reed cost 1 food each; stone costs 2 food.",,,
D126,耕田者,Field Cultivator,T3,,,畑の耕作者,收获7个的话合计是木砖芦×2和石头1。从序盘开始做小麦田的话，这个效果还不错。,"Pile 1 wood, 1 clay, 1 reed, 1 stone, 1 reed, 1 clay, and 1 wood on this card. Each time you harvest a field tile, you can also take the top good from the pile.",,,
D127,努力工作者,Hardworking Man,T4,,,稼ぎ頭,并不是在使用行动空间，所以日雇组合、教师讲桌、森林劳役者等不会发动。,"This card is an action space for you only. If each other player has more rooms than you, it provides the ""Day Laborer"", ""Building Rooms"", and ""Major Improvement"" actions (all three).",,,
D129,木艺大师,Lumber Virtuoso,T3,,,材木の名手,在第1阶段、第2阶段分别收集5木2芦的话，就能在收获阶段进行建造，因此相当于减轻了1手的消耗。行动会稍微受到限制，但效果还算不错。中盘以后还能建厩的效果也令人开心。,"Each harvest in which you have at least 5 wood in your supply, you can discard down to 5 wood to take a ""Build Stables"" or ""Build Wood Rooms"" action by paying the usual costs.",,,
D130,休闲木匠,Recreational Carpenter,T1,,,日曜大工,也可以进行多户扩建，而且在石头较轻的局面下，后期通过石屋扩建也能瞄准奖励分。,"At the end of each work phase in which you did not use the ""Meeting Place"" action space, you can take a ""Build Rooms"" action without placing a person.",,,
D131,手工艺推广人,Craftsmanship Promoter,T3,,,職人技奨励者,和商人或按订单生产的工匠成套搭配使用吧。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 stone. You can build any of the major improvements in the bottom row of the supply board even when taking a ""Minor Improvement"" action.",,,
D133,啤酒棚老板,Beer Tent Operator,T3,,,ビール露店経営者,转换效率还算可以。如果木材和小麦都能大量产出的话，也可以作为选项。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, you can use this card to turn 1 wood plus 1 grain into 1 bonus point and 2 food.",,,
D134,吃牡蛎的人,Oyster Eater,T3,,,牡蠣食べ,即使没有渔连段，发动4次左右也有不错的效果。有渔连段的话就不用说有多强了。基本上渔业并不会被那么优先地放进去，因此被跳过回合的缺点也没有那么大。即使自己已经完成家人的放置，也能得到1分。,"Each time the ""Fishing"" accumulation space is used, you get 1 bonus point and must skip placing your next person that round. (You can place the person on a later turn.)",,,
D135,园林主管官员,Gardening Head Official,T2,,,園芸事務長,因为参照的是最后一次收获后的田地，所以基本上不在14R播种就无法获得奖励。栽培饲料作物的人可以在收获后播种，因此相性很好。,"If there are still 3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with the most vegetables in their fields gets 2 bonus points.",,,
D136,动物权益保护者,Animal Activist,T2,,,家畜活動家,与厩舍相关卡牌成套运用吧。,"If there are still 3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with the most fenced stables gets 2 bonus points.",,,
D137,贸易导师,Trade Teacher,T0,,,交易教師,只要有厨房就能做任何事。不想总是只吃家畜，也想尽早建立繁殖体制来稳定食料。打出时效果也会发动。和雕刻学科相性很好。小麦为0、在已打出烤面包棒的状态下起动也烤不了小麦（先烤面包）,"Each time after you use a ""Lesson"" action space, you can buy up to 2 different goods: grain, stone, sheep, and wild boar for 1 food each; cattle and vegetable for 2 food each.",,,
D139,会长,Chairman,T3,,,議長,大概能拿到10饭左右。虽说如此，因为场上整体的饭会变少，所以也不能算是特别协力。,"Each time another player uses the ""Meeting Place"" action space, both they and you get 1 food (before taking the actions). If you use it, you get 1 food.",,,
D140,高谈阔论者,Loudmouth,T3,,,大口叩き,大体就是搬运工的弱化版。即使出了像森林保护者那样能把资源返回到版图上的卡，得到的也只是食料，所以并没有那么强力。,"Each time you take at least 4 building resources or 4 animals from an accumulation space, you also get 1 food.",,,
D142,土豆种植者,Potato Planter,T3,,,じゃがいも植え,在砖1或2，或者芦苇1的状态下，再去占另一个格子吧。既然要出，那就想至少发动2次。,"At the end of each work phase in which you occupy the ""Clay Pit"" or ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space while the respective other is unoccupied, you get 1 vegetable.",,,
D143,砍树工,Tree Cutter,T2,,,木材裁断師,渔小剧场大多是在砖条件下发动吗。用想活用砖的手牌进入4砖或3砖、4饭等，可以一点点地收集栅材。也可以用家畜发动,"Each time you use an accumulation space providing at least 3 goods of the same type except wood, you get an additional 1 wood. (Food is also considered a good.)",,,
D145,屋顶质检员,Roof Examiner,T3,,,屋根点検者,如果芦苇很紧缺的话，中盘的2芦苇就相当珍贵。要是拿了篮编的话，后盘也能成为得分来源。,"When you play this card, if you have 1/2/3/4 major improvements, you immediately get 2/3/4/5 reed.",,,
D147,陷阱修建工,Trap Builder,T2,,,罠づくり,如果有厨房就能变成7饭。跑两趟的话还能做到8饭+也可以顺便瞄准繁殖，因此即使单独使用也不是不差的效果。,"Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, place 1 food, 1 food, and 1 wild boar on the next 3 round spaces, respectively. At the start of these rounds, you get the good.",,,
D149,临时员工,Casual Worker,T2,,,臨時労働者,建造马厩的效果很优秀。由于2处采石场合计会掉落11~14石头，因此也完全可以瞄准启动4次以上。自己去也不会触发，所以想要石头的话就优先去资源市场吧。,"Each time another player uses a ""Quarry"" accumulation space, you can choose to get 1 food or build a stable without paying wood.",,,
D150,虔诚的配偶,Godly Spouse,T3,,,信仰深い配偶者,编辑中,"Each time you take a ""Family Growth"" action with the second person you place in a round, return the first person you placed home.",,,
D151,公关专家,Spin Doctor,T3,,,スピンドクター,虽然要花些工夫，但能确保耕作稳定进行2次这一点很重要。,"Immediately after each time you use the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you can place another person on an action space of your choice, regardless whether or not the action space is occupied.",,,
D153,大富翁,Wealthy Man,T4,,,裕福な男,如果是1~3阶段的收获倒不是不能瞄准，但之后就很难自然触发了。和畑番成套的话可以发挥效果，但考虑到打出要花1手，这效果就显得有点不够看。,"At the start of each of the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th/6th harvest, if you have at least 1/2/3/4/5/6 grain fields, you get 1 bonus point.",,,
D155,,Ebonist,,,,黒檀細工職人,稳定的小麦补助。收获时要特别注意不要忘记操作。,"Each harvest, you can use this card to turn exactly 1 wood into 1 food and 1 grain.",,,
D156,零售商,Retail Dealer,T2,,,小売業者,如果能在中盘之前打出，3次通过也不算太勉强。还能拿到1饭，在食料基础没完善之前相当有用。,"Place 3 grain and 3 food on this card. Each time you use the ""Resource Market"" action space, you also get 1 grain and 1 food from this card.",,,
D157,派对组织者,Party Organizer,T2,,,パーティー主催者,扣除打出的成本后，每手6~7饭。,"As soon as the next player but you gains their 5th person, you immediately get 8 food (not retroactively). During scoring, if only you have 5 people, you get 3 bonus points.",,,
D159,芦苇销售商,Reed Seller,T3,,,葦売り,,"At any time, you can turn 1 reed into 3 food. Any other player can prevent this by buying the reed for 2 food from you. If multiple players are interested, choose one.",,,
D160,助产士,Midwife,T2,E,,助産師,自己去做也不会触发是个难点。5～7回合的增员格子出现得晚的话，增员会变得拥挤，所以效果更容易触发。,"Each time another player uses the first person they place in a round to take a ""Family Growth"" action, you get 1 grain from the general supply.",,"Midwife If you are in a position where you are going to get a lot of food from the
Midwife, you are not going to win.",
D161,卷心菜采购商,Cabbage Buyer,T2,,,キャベツ買い,,"Each time any player (including you) renovates and the builds no/ 1 minor/ 1 major improvement, you can buy 1 vegetable for 3/2/1 food.",,,
D163,熟练砌墙工,Journeyman Bricklayer,T3,,,旅する壁職人,虽然需要在中盘之前打出来，但相当于4石左右。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 2 stone. Each time another player renovates to stone or builds a stone room, you get 1 stone.",,,
D164,宠物饲养员,Pet Grower,T3,,,ペット育成人,发动机会也很少，就算能发动也就羊3左右,"Each time you use an animal accumulation space, if afterward you have no animal in your house, you also get 1 sheep.",,,
D165,野猪追猎者,Pig Stalker,T3,,,猪追い,不清楚细节规格。需要验证。尽管如此，感觉不太好用…。,"Each time you use an animal accumulation space, if you occupy either the action space immediately above or below that accumulation space, you also get 1 wild boar.",,,
D166,牛棚挤奶工,Stable Milker,T3,,,厩の乳搾り,和其他厩系的卡片成套运用吧。若只是拿1牛，用家畜市场就足够了，所以想启动2次。,"Each time you build at least 2 stables on the same turn, you also get 1 cattle.",,,
D167,纯种哺育师,Pure Breeder,T3,,,純血種の育成者,走早点繁殖野猪或牛的路线会非常强力。到了后期繁殖机会会减少。,"You immediately get 1 wood. After each round that does not end with a harvest, you can breed exactly one type of animal. (This is not considered a breeding phase.)",,,
E001,竹杆棚,Pole Barns,,,D,簡易納屋,只要连15柵都立起来就很优秀。和厩系卡搭配也◎,You can immediately build up to 3 stables at no cost.,,,后期有条件的二木换三分，条件不算太高，但也只有早围卡组用得到它。如果动物特别多的话，收益可以更高一点。
E002,翻修建材,Renovation Materials,,,,改築資材,在砖块很沉重的局里做了5栋木屋等情况下非常优秀。即使单卡作为手牌压缩或防止改建事故也不差。,Immediately renovate to clay at no cost. (You must pay the cost of this card though.),,,
E003,茶点时间,Tea Time,,,,ティータイム,虽然使用机会相当有限，但如果用得好就很优秀。能从增员进步或改筑进步中出就最好。,"Immediately return your person on the ""Grain Utilization"" action space home; you can place it again later this round.",,,
E004,突发事件,Thunderbolt,,,,落雷,如果放上3个小麦，就会变成6木。作为小麦的利用方法算是还不错。,Immediately remove all grain from one of your fields to the general supply. Gain 2 wood for each grain you just removed.,,,
E005,夜间劫掠,Night Loot,,,,夜の戦利品,用手牌就能拿到不足的2种资材，这是比看上去更灵活、很优秀的效果。也能妨碍其他人。,Immediately remove exactly 2 different building resources from accumulation spaces and place them in your supply.,,,
E006,清点资源,Recount,,,,再集計,视情况而定。用石头或芦苇来顺利发动有点困难。,You immediately get 1 building resource of each type of which you have 4 or more resources in your supply already.,,,
E007,粗麦面包,Pumpernickel,,,,ライ麦パン,转换效率还算可以，但把唯一的1个小麦拿去交换就不划算。等通过职业或播种能在一定程度上供应小麦之后再用吧。,"You immediately get 4 food. (Effectively, you are turning 1 grain into 4 food.)",,,
E008,农夫市场,Farmers Market,,,,農産物直売所,无论是从序盘开始就活用蔬菜，还是在终盘处于蔬菜0的状态下拿1蔬菜，都是不差的效果，泛用性很高。,"You immediately get 1 vegetable. (Effectively, you are buying 1 vegetable for 2 food.)",,,
E009,交易小屋,Bartering Hut,,,,取引小屋,可以把多余的资源转换成家畜。不过成本很高。中盘用来进行两种繁殖，或者终盘为了获得一只都没有的家畜而使用吧。,Up to two times: Immediately spend any 2/3/4 building resources for 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle from the general supply.,,,
E010,草帽,Straw Hat,,,,麦わら帽子,如果想从前期就开始耕地的话，这不是个坏效果，但若要赶在第3轮前完成，1芦苇的成本就太重了。,"At the end of the work phases of rounds 3 and 6, you can move your person from the ""Farmland"" action space to an unoccupied action space and take that action, or get 1 food.",,,
E011,宠物动物园,Petting Zoo,,,F,ふれあい動物園,即使种类不同也没关系，用这个和小型牧场再加上1张卡也完全可以瞄准2种繁殖。从中盘开始想要好好地收集家畜并让它们繁殖下去。,"As long as you have a pasture orthogonally adjacent to your house, you can keep animals of any type on this card, up to the number of rooms in your house.",,,纯垃圾
E012,动物草垫,Animal Bedding,,,E,家畜の寝具,终盘可以轻松打出的1分卡。中盘也能做出7栏2格牧场来进行2种繁殖。在田地很多而牧场偏小的情况下尤其能发挥作用。,"You can keep 1 additional animal (of the same type) in each of your unfenced stables, and 2 additional animals (of the same type) in each pasture with stable.",,,一分白板
E013,重建石屋,Stone House Reconstruction,,,,石の家改築,用于石家连招中的手牌压缩，以及防止终盘的改建事故。因1石=1点，所以即使只是单纯打出也不坏。,"At any time, you can renovate your clay house to a stone house without placing a person. (You must pay the normal renovation cost.)",,,
E014,木工锯,Wood Saw,,,D,木製のこぎり,如果在序盘建造小麦田，这是个优秀的效果。它参考的不是房间数而是家族人数，所以即使有玩家通过移动住宅或干草仓增员，也能发动效果。,"Each time all other players have more people than you, you can take a ""Build Rooms"" action without placing a person.",,,条件是末生，收益是给一动。但是工具给的这一动非常强。他首先他有一些奇怪的配合，就是你可以用它多次扩房配合房生什么的。第二他给的资源非常强，他是在你前期行动比较紧张的房屋扩建中价值一动，这一动可以让你排除掉就是别人卡马厩之类的烦恼，你可以直接抢首发然后生娃。这张卡是一张在轮抽里非常值得注意的卡。如果有木工锯的话，你在这一把里就要敲响警钟，不要乱卡马厩也不要想着插生之类的事情。这张卡在特殊卡组里会特别强。我觉得他也是有一个D级水平的，但是总归不算太通用，也不值得只为了这一张单卡自己晚生。
E015,铁钉篮子,Nail Basket,,,E,釘入れかご,获得累积的木材后就能起动效果来建造栅栏。在木材比较吃紧、栅栏位拥挤的场面下是很优秀的效果。也能和生け垣管理人形成连动。如果能顺利捡到石头或芦苇，单卡运用就算只起动1次也足够。,"Each time after you use a wood accumulation space, you can place 1 stone from your supply on that space (for the next visitor) to take a “Build Fences” action.",,,一分白板
E016,荆棘篱笆,Briar Hedge,,,A,茨の垣根,虽然条件较重，但在盘面右侧建造6格牧场时最多可减免7木。通过先建造厩舍或1格牧场，更容易达成条件，从而最大限度地发挥效果。,You do not need to pay wood for fences that you build on the edge of your farmyard board.,,,木头系天花板，这张卡给的木头实在是太多了。这张卡可以给整整八根木头。如果你围八的话，可以给八根木头，如果围六的话，可以给七个木。你只要抓了这张卡的话，你后期就几乎不需要为木头而担心，你只需要考虑怎么样能够把这张卡做出来。做出来的情况下通常会亏一动，但是你在亏一动的情况下，你可以获得一个接近于五动的收益，至少是四动的收益。但这也是非常令人满意的一件事情。而且本身你对一个晚围卡组来讲，那你肯定不能指望你围完再去拿木头。所以说他在一个晚围卡组里，他对那个副作用是非常小。
E017,撇犁,Skimmer Plow,,,B,地ならし鋤,虽然种点不容易提升，但用1木的成本每次都能增加田地这一点非常优秀。,"Each time you use the ""Farmland"" or ""Cultivation"" action space, you can plow 2 fields instead of 1. Each time you sow, you must place 1 fewer good on each field you sow.",,,基本是是个犁都是这个级别吧，但是它的收益没有那么高，因为很难做到一个季都不播种。每播种一次，相当于每个田本身的收益是2.5分，但是这张牌会让田跌到1.5到2分，所以这个犁本身没有那么强。
E018,种子年鉴,Seed Almanac,,,A,種子図鑑,从前期开始就想用在能打出多张职业的构成里的效果。,"Each time after you play a minor improvement after this one, you can pay 1 food to plow 1 field.",,,五动核心卡，价值五动的超级大核心。算上一芦苇的这个成本的话，也是算是一张四分卡。这和荆棘篱笆是一样的收益，但是比荆棘篱笆要难做一点。因为他必须作为第一个发展，至少也是第二个发展卡打出，意味着你要在生娃前打够四个职业。这个还是比较难凑的，通常这个是要亏生娃的顺位的。但是你打出他的话，你后面可以直接赚五动，也就是说你生完亏一圈都是值得的，只是一个赚多赚少的问题。肯定是一个A级别的卡。但是真实收益那平均应该是在2~4度。
E019,赶牛棒,Ox Goad,,,B,牛突き棒,吃饭消耗很重，但能拿到农田很优秀。看起来和“动物喜欢”很契合，但其实“动物喜欢”因为判定为未使用行动空间，所以不形成连动。需注意。,"Each time after you use the ""Cattle Market"" accumulation space, you can pay 2 food to plow 1 field.",,,牛犁，本身是D，每发动一次上升一个梯度，发动两次上升两个梯度。但是想发动三次的话，那也不太现实。有时候发挥两次都是要亏本身行动收益的，意味着你需要更早的去拿一牛。整体是在B-D的位置。
E020,铁锄头,Iron Hoe,,,,鉄のくわ,看其他人的动向，在合适的时机把两个都加进去吧。,"At the end of each work phase, if you occupy both the ""Grain Seeds"" and ""Vegetable Seeds"" action spaces, you can plow 1 field.",,,
E021,羊毛地毯,Sheep Rug,,,,羊皮の絨毯,羊版的卧室。话虽如此，相比小麦田，羊繁殖更难发挥，所以并不能说有那么优秀。,"You can use any ""Wish for Children"" action space, even if it is occupied by another player's person.",,,
E022,客房,Guest Room,,,B,客室,如果能用成吉思汗之类大量出饭的话，这效果还不坏。不过，打出成本也很重，所以如果没必要执着于2家推进的话，老老实实地增筑增员会更稳妥。,"Immediately place any amount of food from your supply on this card. Once per round, you can discard 1 food from this card to place a person from your supply in that round.",,,你抓他之后，就是你打客房就跟你家庭版拿一个首生这两件事收益是差不多的。但是家庭版的首生你不一定能拿到客房打出来一个是稳定性要好，你也不怕牺牲也不怕什么，稳定性要好。然后稳定拿到首生的话，基本上他的总体算是一个两动收益。所以他在B级里算是一张比较强的卡。你用它去获得一个娃，是要比你用一些不卡生的生卡去获得一个娃要来得更加方便的。
E023,养蜂场,Apiary,,,C,養蜂場,职业条件很重，但每次都能播种还算不错。,"At the end of each work phase, you can sow exactly 1 crop on 1 field.",,,一般来讲是赚两动，就是没有特殊配合的情况下。但是但是他这个四直接打出条件，前期想要完成，就是在第一个收完前想要完成同样还是有难度。但是完成的情况下给两动。总体来讲就是因为他要求比较高，所以就放在C级。那如果这个这个要求低一点的话呢，它是可以有B级的。正常情况下他打出来的时间是在第九回合左右，你可以挡住他，挡下了他之后，他就可以给你一个两边的收益。但是问题在于第九回合不一定想要去打一张发展卡。除非你有什么速度增加之类的东西，这张卡的梯度可以适当上移。
E024,雄心壮志,Ambition,,,,野心,意外地优秀的用法并不多。进行“かま調”交换，或者与马具屋、墙匠的师傅搭配来收集大进才是理想吗。,"Each time you get a ""Minor Improvement"" action on an action space, you can build a major improvement instead of playing a minor one.",,,
E025,,Bumper Crop,,,,豊作,,"When you play this card, immediately play the field phase of the harvest on your farmyard only.",,,
E026,日晷,Sundial,,,,日時計,只要把种子和田地的前期准备做好，就是非常优秀的手牌压缩效果。若能用增员进步打出，手牌效率很高。,"At the end of the work phases in rounds 7 and 9, you can take a ""Sow"" action without placing a person.",,,
E027,小猪存钱罐,Piggy Bank,,,B,貯金箱,如果能顺利回收井户的话最好。序盘要单体运用的话饭消耗偏重，所以想和饭补助搭配使用。也可以最速出并起动2次，但很多时候不会留下什么像样的进步，所以起动1次比较稳妥。,"At the end of each work phase, you can place 1 food on this card, irretrievably. At any time, you can discard 6 food from this card to build a major improvement at no cost.",,,这个东西就是六口饭换田。算是一张很好的核心卡了。他就是你只要前期饭多，你前期饭多你就可以相当于是一张四星卡。四星卡条件前期不缺饭，然后在大部分情况下都是可以拿的。甚至你围绕他去多拿点饭卡都可以。同时它在这个后期他还可以，就是你如果前期缺田的情况下，那你中期总不吃饭了吧。那你就用它去拿一些别人没人要的主发，从而你用这个东西去做出来一些奇怪的东西。比如比如最简单，它是可以配合那张柴火的，就是你在后期去打一些别人不要的烤炉。他主要是起到这个作品，就是有配合，而且单卡只要有饭他就能抓你。前期如果有一张爱宠或者什么之类的卡位，就直接毫不犹豫的可以把他抓下来。
E028,书签,Bookmark,,,E028,しおり,虽然有一点时间延迟，但不挑情况、泛用性很高的卡。,"Add 3 to the current round and mark the corresponding round space. At the start of that round, you can play 1 occupation without paying an occupation cost.",,,标准一动卡。在一动卡里算是稍强一点的位置，但是没有强太多。延迟三回合的限制并不小。
E029,传家宝,Heirloom,,,,家宝,如果是日雇组合就很优秀。即使不是日雇组合，在上限分几乎没有了的情况下，也能发挥2手2分的作用。,(This card has no additional effect.),,,
E030,儿童玩具,Child's Toy,,,,子供のおもちゃ,虽然有可能会稍微增加一些食物消耗，但如果能在增员前打出就得2分。作为条件，即使有新生儿也没问题，所以从增员进步也能打出。,"During the feeding phase of each harvest, your newborns require 2 food (instead of 1).",,,"效果：两个卡
强度：其实所以一般都是在两个卡里比较差的。因为它的就是一次，那当然他给的是这个高贵的上下文。他几个优势，而且他一定要求打的时间比较早。另外一个是他底下的副作用是客观存在的。从平均来讲的话，他们也是要付出1.5万的代价，那排队收益不是很高了。如果你觉得这张卡，你其实可以参考一张丘陵宅院，觉得他和丘陵宅院的性质差不太多，就是成本差不太多，收益也差不太多。但是比丘尼怎样的适应性要好一点。毕竟就是也是一张你在收打的时候，你不想打卡的时候去打他的一张卡。"
E031,室内装潢,Upholstery,,,,室内装飾品,如果是芦苇较轻的场地的话，是非常优秀的效果。,"Each time you build or play an improvement after this one, you can place 1 reed on this card, irretrievably, to get 1 bonus point, up to the number of rooms in your house.",,,
E032,正厅,Nave,,,B,身廊,在下排横向笔直地建房子拿奖励分。需要稍微留意一下栅栏和田地的摆放，但这是张泛用性很高的奖励分卡。不改建也没问题这一点也很令人开心。,"During scoring, you get 1 bonus point for each of the 5 columns of your farmyard board containing at least one room.",,,"效果：后期上限卡
强度：它和这个半路其实算是完全一样的性价比。就是它的净赚多少，你拿他打他，如果拿四出的话，那他其实净赚也就两分。两个十多个亿，芦苇本身值一分，同时你本身那样一个造型，造型上也要扣0.5分，就是俩石头一芦苇在里边就是值1.5分，一个造型上亏了1.5分。正厅这张卡通常认为就是净赚两分的一张卡，没有很强。但是它的好处是在于，就是如果你房子扩的比较高的话，你在后期实际上是有非常多的行动想要去拿一些上限。它是一张高贵的后期一张显卡。在这个情况下的话，他是要比这家室内装潢要强的。但是他同样还是那还是那件事，就是它是一张就是虽然他很值得抓，也就是说抓位还是比较高的。但是他的问题在于他的抓位虽然高，但他并不强。他你可以理解为他和客房一样，只是一个稳定性的手段，而不是强度。"
E033,海狸群,Beaver Colony,,,,ビーバーの巣,打出的条件和打出后的限制都比较重，但每次进入资材市场就得1分这一点非常强力。以篮编制为首，能够有效利用芦苇的手段是必不可少的。注意，像森林评论家那样，即使通过卡牌效果从行动栏位以外获得芦苇也不会发动。,"From now on, one of your pastures with stable cannot hold animals. Each time you get reed from an action space, you get 1 bonus point.",,,
E034,土地登记册,Land Register,,,,登記簿,泛用性很高的1木2点卡牌,"During scoring, if your farm has no unused spaces, you get 2 bonus points.",,,
E035,厌世主义,Misanthropy,,,,人間不信,基本上老老实实进急子会更强，所以泛用性较低,"During scoring, if you have exactly 4/3/2 people, you get 2/3/5 bonus points.",,,
E036,草药园,Herbal Garden,,,,ハーブ園,虽然有条件和缺点，但1木2分。繁殖3种的话不太好用，但除此之外似乎有很多场面还能想办法应付。,"From now on, at least one of your pastures must contain no animals.",,,
E037,牛头骨,Ox Skull,,,,牛の頭骨,从牛0的状态开始，通过“1牛→出牛的头骨→在厨房烤牛”的操作，2步就能完成获得3分4饭的行动。虽然会附带不能养牛的限制，但还算不错。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 food. During scoring, if you have no cattle, you get 3 bonus points.",,,"效果：一分白板
强度：卡比一分白板多头牛，所以比一分白板强。摆在摆在这个位置吧，比比一分白板多头牛，只要不养牛的卡组都可以抓。"
E038,鱼竿收藏,Rod Collection,,,,釣竿集め,大体是把2木转换成1分的效果。要启动需要去打渔，而且分数效率也并不是那么高。适合终盘的1分卡。,"Each time you use ""Fishing"", you can place up to 2 wood on this card, irretrievably. During scoring, each such wood is worth 1 bonus point, except the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th.",,,
E039,画笔,Paintbrush,,,,絵筆,猪的条件是个瓶颈，但如果在中盘捡到大量砖块并能多次启动的话，就是很优秀的效果。可以的话想把它转换成1分。,"Each harvest, you can exchange exactly 1 clay for your choice of 2 food or 1 bonus point.",,,"效果：上限卡
强度：这张卡的上限感觉还是蛮高的。这张卡的前提就是你要有猪，这个猪从哪里来比较关键。但是你哪怕第四期弄一头猪的话，他都可以用四个资源去换三份。你在就是四个资源换三分，关键是砖这个资源比较便宜。就是他和正厅这两张卡，可能级别是收益是相差不多的，就是都是资源成本和收益都差不多。正经很多时候也就四环完事了，因为他俩就是都是和和这个摆烂的三分画笔，都是一个水平。暂时画笔要比正经打的时间要早一点，就算是画笔一个缺陷。所以画笔的差不多是排在这个位置，算是一张不错的这个上限卡。"
E040,蜜蜂雕像,Bee Statue,,,,蜂の彫像,和日雇组合一起用。在获得蔬菜之前需要花时间。,"Pile (from bottom to top) 1 vegetable, 1 stone, 1 grain, 1 stone, 1 grain on this card. Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you get the top good.",,,
E041,泥浆,Muddy Waters,,,,泥水,在第7轮打出时有2砖2粮1分的效果。不过要尽早打出条件偏严，而且到获得效果前有时间差，后期砖的用处也会变得有限，所以不能说有多优秀。后期作为1分1粮用的卡打出似乎最容易用。,"Alternate placing 1 food and 1 clay on each remaining even-numbered round space, starting with food. At the start of these rounds, you get the respective good.",,,
E042,水沟,Water Gully,,,,水路,只要能想办法满足井户条件，就是最强级别的效果。从序盘开始就去资源市场，想办法确保石头吧。,"Place 1 cattle, 1 grain, and 1 cattle on the next 3 round spaces (in that order). At the start of these rounds, you get the respective good.",,,"效果：拿田
强度：拿到田这件事情其实是有点高之。你能看到水沟就可能会去抽你的技能，仅仅说这样的话，这张卡如果能打出来的话，收益是挺高的。但是因为风险太高，这张卡不出来，所以这张卡总体就是只能排在这个位置。因为这张卡太容易被穿了，然后打的话扣三个时机也比较固定。你前期早期打不开局，那这张卡的时期基本上已经锁死在11回合了。因为如果11回合去一共抢一个骑士，你就会很难受。"
E043,棚舍小猫,Barn Cats,,,,納屋の猫,只要有马厩就能拿1分和饭。在马厩系combo里自不必说，即使单卡也相当好用的效果。,"If you have 1/2/3/4 stables, place 1 food on each of the next 2/3/4/5 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
E044,甜菜饲料,Fodder Beets,,,,飼料用ビート,中盘打出提供饭补助，或者后期打出得1分。,"Place 1 food on each remaining odd-numbered round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
E045,果园梯子,Fruit Ladder,,,,折りたたみはしご,第1回合打出是7饭，但性能也不至于值得用掉2木来打出。木头专家是最佳搭档。,"Place 1 food on each remaining even-numbered round space. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
E046,睡莲池塘,Waterlily Pond,,,,睡蓮の池,如果能把握好时机打出，就是1分2饭。,"Place 1 food on each of the next 2 round spaces. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
E047,糖浆水龙头,Syrup Tap,,,,樹液採取器,虽然是前期想打出的效果，但成本有点偏重。,"Each time you get at least 1 wood from an action space, place 1 food on the next round space. At the start of that round, you get the food.",,,
E048,市政厅,Town Hall,,,,町役場,成本偏重，在砖房里作为饭补助也有点微妙。就当作石房连招用，或者作为终盘的2分卡来用吧。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, if you live in a clay or stone house, you get 1 or 2 food, respectively.",,,
E049,鹤嘴斧,Twibil,,,,両頭つるはし,如果所有人都各增建一次木屋，就是4饭的工作量。从开局的资源市场的石头里可以不勉强地掏出来，效果还算不错。,"Each time after any player (including you) builds at least 1 wood room, you get 1 food.",,,
E050,野菜,Wild Greens,,,,野草,如果从序盘开始播种的话，多少还是能拿出一些饭的。不过要是要打出这张卡，经常会遇到这样的局面：宁愿生吃小麦去优先做别的事，也会觉得为打出这张卡而花掉的那1手很可惜。,"Each time you sow, you get 1 food for every different type of good that you sow.",,,"效果：提供蔬菜
强度：就是这就是一张没没卡打的时候可以打一下卡，一卡打对，就这个水平没啥没啥卡可抓，你抓一张也算绝对不亏。给刘胜一五就一点点赞，没啥能拿野菜。想要当核心的话，那他唯一的配合基本上就是养蜂巢了。除了他之外，这个野菜基本上就是不痛不痒的三四口饭，乐岛非要用野菜来吃的情况下，也就不好打。"
E051,鲸油,Whale Oil,,,,鯨油,和渔系combo成套。,"Each time you use ""Fishing"", place 1 food from the general supply on this card. Each time before you play an occupation, you get food equal to the amount on this card.",,,
E052,小房间,Cubbyhole,,,B,小部屋,鸡舍的亲戚。费用偏高，但如果能顺利打出并进行增筑，就能成为相当可观的食物补助。比如在2ステ增筑2间、在4ステ增筑1间的话，总计能产出13饭。想和增筑补助搭配使用。,"For each room that you add to your house, place 1 food from the general supply on this card. At the start of each feeding phase, you get food equal to the amount on this card.",,,"效果：后期食物核心卡
强度：它也是一张就是批判用的核心卡。它和去哪这三张卡我觉得比较像的，福小房间和东方火炉的。一个是要卖田来吃来给饭，一个是要你只要拿一个火炉来给饭。这个稍微贵一点，这就是这三张卡应该都是同一级别的，算是一张后期的食物核心卡。我觉得他的小房间的话一般就是要冲着装裤子，就是如果用小房间打折扣的房子，他可以说是无损给饭的，还是非常强大的。而且给的还挺多的，能给到十几口的话就很厉害。"
E053,捕猪矛,Boar Spear,,,,ボアスピア,虽然限定猪，但转换效率优秀。即使一次获得多只猪，也能不放跑地启动效果。用于不拿厨房时的饭补助。,"Each time you get at least 1 wild boar outside of the breeding phase of a harvest, you can immediately turn them into 4 food each.",,,
E054,走私货,Contraband,,,,密輸品,在物资较轻的场合还能算是不错的饭补助。,"Each time you play or build an improvement after this, you can pay 1 additional building resource of a type in the printed cost to get 3 food.",,,"效果：发展卡相关
强度：就是走私货这张卡发动几次战的。就是你早期外发动第一次差不多是不赚不亏，你发打出来，发动第二次之后才开始赚。那他就是按强度就取决于你能够多快的能够打出发展卡。如果你打这个走私货之后连着这个连打一堆发展的走势都挺强大的。但是在大部分无法做到这一点的卡组里，这个走私货效果是，就他不太是一张能够连发的卡。就是正常情况下，你很难连续打这么多张发量卡。走私货总体没有裸照强度，大概是放在这个位置。"
E055,石坝,Stone Weir,,,,石の堰,和渔系的连招和套装一起。仅仅只是得到4饭是赢不了的。,"Each time you use the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, if there are 0/1/2/3 food on the space, you get an additional 4/3/2/1 food from the general supply.",,,
E056,罗马罐,Roman Pot,,,,ローマ土器,下家如果是SP就1饭。因为很难瞄准并发挥效果，所以只是那种如果顺势能打出来就打出来的卡。,"Place 4 food from the general supply on this card. At the start of each work phase, if you are the last player in turn order, move 1 food from this card to your supply.",,,
E057,奶酪火锅,Cheese Fondue,,,,チーズフォンデュ,效果比较朴素，但如果同时拥有羊和牛就会增加2饭，因此在终盘能作为饭的补助。即使一次烤多个小麦，效果也只会发动1次。,"Each time you bake at least 1 grain into bread, you get 1 additional food if you have at least 1 sheep and (another) 1 additional food if you have at least 1 cattle.",,,
E058,午餐啤酒,Lunchtime Beer,,,,昼時のビール,,"At the start of each harvest, you can choose to skip the field and breeding phase of that harvest and get exactly 1 food instead.",,,
E059,羊毛梳剪,Comb and Cutter,,,,刃付き櫛,效果不稳定，单独使用时有点难以运用。和日雇组合一起用。,"Each time you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you get 1 additional food for each sheep on the ""Sheep Market"" accumulation space, up to a maximum of 4 additional food.",,,
E060,工人手套,Working Gloves,,,,軍手,,"When you play this card, you get 1 food. Each time you pay an occupation cost, you can pay 1 building resource of your choice in place of (up to) 2 food.",,,
E061,垄作,Raised Bed,,,,揚げ床,条件和成本都很重，但只要能打出来就很强力。要是能顺利在2ステ打出来就能有20饭，但问题是实在不好出。,"At the start of each harvest, you get 4 food.",,,
E062,生面团,Sour Dough,,,,発酵生地,可以通过跳过回合来进行容易翻车的烤面包的优秀效果。,"Once per round, if all players have at least 1 person left to place, you can skip placing a person and take a ""Bake Bread"" action instead.",,,
E063,铁造烤炉,Iron Oven,,,,鉄窯,可以用小进步打出，高效地烤面包。得分效率也不差。,"""Bake Bread"" action: At most 1 time Grain → 6 Food When you play this card, you can immediately take a ""Bake Bread"" action.",,,
E064,简易烤炉,Simple Oven,,,,簡易窯,虽然容易打出，但烤面包效率和厨房相同，称不上强力。作用程度也就是在烤面包路线里作为保险持有。拿到其他烤面包进步之后，也可以为了启动1次烤面包效果而打出它。,"""Bake Bread"" action: At most 1 time Grain → 3 Food When you play this card, you can immediately take a ""Bake Bread"" action.",,,
E065,救济包,Almsbag,,,,お布施袋,如果前期没有特别想出的职业，这个效果也不算差。为了把获得的小麦利用起来，最好先准备好田地。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 grain for every 2 completed rounds.",,,
E066,谷仓棚,Barn Shed,,,,穀物小屋,成本和条件都很重，但只要能出，几乎每回合都能拿到小麦。只是单纯获得小麦并不算很强，所以想通过烤面包等方式有效利用。注意如果是自己进去的话就拿不到。,"Each time another player (or, in a solo game, you) uses the ""Forest"" accumulation space, you get 1 grain.",,,
E067,粮食袋,Grain Bag,,,,穀物袋,厨房也属于烤面包进步，因此也成为效果的对象。,"Each time you use the ""Grain Seeds"" action space, you get 1 additional grain for each baking improvement you have.",,,
E068,樱桃园,Cherry Orchard,,,,サクランボ果樹園,如果在中盘撒小麦的话，不算差的效果。,"This card is a field on which you can only sow and harvest wood as you would grain. Each time you harvest the last wood from this card, you also get 1 vegetable.",,,
E069,瓜田,Melon Patch,,,,メロン畑,只要在5阶段用田地种子播种蔬菜，最后收获时田地就会回到手上。触发两次效果有点忙，但只触发一次也已经足够强力。,"This card is a field that can only grow vegetables. Each time you harvest the last vegetable from this card, you can plow 1 field.",,,
E070,轮作田,Crop Rotation Field,,,,輪作畑,小麦→蔬菜→小麦→，这样交替种植的效果。如果有能额外收获的效果，就能加快轮作循环，从而高效率地增加种子。,"This card is a field. Each time you remove the last grain or vegetable from this card, you can immediately sow vegetable or grain on this card, respectively.",,,
E071,牛肉馅饼,Cow Patty,,,,牛糞,虽然是除终盘以外很难打出的条件，但效果还算可以。蔬菜哪怕只多增加1个，也能算作1分。,"Each time you sow in a field that is orthogonally adjacent to a pasture, you can place 1 additional good of the planted type in it.",,,
E072,洋蓟田,Artichoke Field,,,,アーティチョーク畑,如果能从序盘就打出，可以作为一点饭的补助，但职业条件偏重。效果不差，但也不至于非要勉强去运用。,"This card is a field. During the field phase of each harvest, if you harvest at least 1 good from this card, you also get 1 food.",,,
E073,大镰刀,Scythe,,,,大鎌,想和播种辅助一起配套使用。可以和树木田地打连携，但可能因为BUG的关系，行为似乎不太稳定。,"During the field phase of each harvest, you can select exactly one of your fields and harvest all the crops planted in it.",,,"效果：播种收获
强度：这卡太开想象力了吧，就是能打打出来的配合还是太少。很少有他在这个六六之间。"
E074,白蜡树,Ash Trees,,,,トネリコの木,实际上是5木。条件也没那么难，如果从序盘就要建小麦田的话，这是非常强力的效果。,"When you play this card, immediately place (up to) 5 fences from your supply on it. When you build fences, fences taken from this card cost you nothing.",,,
E075,石斧,Stone Axe,,,A,石斧,如果能大量产出石头，那就毫无怨言地强力。即使单独运用也是不差的效果。仅仅启动1次就把1石1砖转换成1木1点，所以可以说至少能发挥基本作用。要是木头看起来比较紧张的话，也想把家具制造也确保下来。,"Each time you use a wood accumulation space, you can return 1 stone to the general supply to get an additional 3 wood.",,,"效果：石头资源
强度：这张卡经常的对比对象是路推，但是这张卡应该他的上限和下限都是要远强于路推的。从上线而言的话，石斧你是可以解锁很多石头卡的装备的，你是比如企业家之类的卡，如果你配合上石斧，他会非常强大。你可以抓非常非常多的石头卡，然后来用来配合石斧，他是增大你的灵活性，而不是减少你的灵活性。第二点是，它的收益是在于前期，RSF是一个非常非常非常强大的行动格，这个行动格的价值是不是2R和三木能比的，这个行动格的竞价值太高了。他唯一的问题就是在于石头不见得能用出去。在这个前提下，石斧提供了一个本sf的石头运出去的解密方案，所以石斧是一张非常非常强大的卡。你从下线的角度的话，他打出的条件要远比例最简单。上线的角度他有更多的配合，而且灵活性也是更高的。总体来讲，石斧是一个非常强大的A级卡。然后他哪怕在后期打出来，他有时候都足够强大了。就是在后期打出来的话，石斧的净收益都可以达到6米这个水平。"
E076,木堆,Lumber Pile,,,,材木の山,如果能在增筑时顺利建出3个厩，就能赚到3木。即使没有厩建设系的combo，效果也还不错。木会一次性返还，所以如果有削り馬的话，只会发动1次。,"When you play this card, you can immediately return up to 3 stables from your farmyard board to your supply and get 3 wood for each.",,,
E077,鹤嘴锄,Mattock,,,,根掘りくわ,如果能在序盘打出，感觉能相当于获得约5砖左右。能在版图上放置石头并活用获得的砖的土壤科学者是最佳搭档。注意：像森林评论家这类卡牌效果，即使从行动格以外获得芦苇或石头也不会触发。,"Each time you get reed and/or stone from an action space, you get 1 additional clay.",,,
E078,小花招,Sleight of Hand,,,,手品,因为无论种类都可以将任意4资源转换成任意4资源，所以能根据改筑或栅栏等情况进行相当灵活的应对。,"When you play this card, you can immediately exchange up to 4 building resources for an equal number of other building resources.",,,"效果：四换四
强度：收益不算高，作用就是作用。其实小花招是没有别的作用小，但唯一作用就是换芦苇。如果小花招不是用来换芦苇的话，那小花招肯定是用亏了。然后你在换芦苇的情况下，他是不赚，但是能够稳定一下你的节奏的卡。有生的情况下想发招的效果非常苦。或许能有一张其他的声卡把声卡打CB，总体差不多是这个水平。"
E079,田地铲,Field Spade,,,,土起こしシャベル,一次撒下多种也只能拿到1个石头。要是从序盘就建小麦田，倒是能出一定的石头，但也称不上值得勉强去出的优秀效果。,"Each time after you sow in at least 1 field, you get 1 stone.",,,
E080,石头园,Rock Garden,,,,石の庭,虽然能增加石头，但要等到真正获利还需要一点时间。若在种植期间井户或石窑被别人抢走，导致石头没了用武之地，那就本末倒置了，所以想要好好周旋，活用增加的石头。,"You can only plant stone on this card. Plant as though it were 3 fields, but it is considered 1 field. Sow and harvest stone on this card as you would vegetables.",,,
E081,炼金室,Alchemists Lab,,,,錬金術師の研究室,只要每种资材都至少持有1个，就能触发よろずや屋效果。最好是先增员再打出，并在最终回合放进去最理想。如果增员不够充分，盘面上的资材往往会剩余，或者被其他人多次放入，结果往往是其他人更占便宜。,"This card is an action space for all. A player who uses it gets 1 building resource of each type they already have. If another player uses it, they must first pay you 1 food.",,,
E082,投机,Profiteering,,,,不当利得,和日雇组合搭配使用。因为可以在与日雇农夫相同的时机启动，所以在增筑改筑时能根据手头的资材灵活调整。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 food. Each time after you use the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you can exchange 1 building resource for another building resource.",,,
E083,牧羊哨,Shepherd's Whistle,,,,牧人の笛,如果有炉灶厨房的话，只要建好马厩，每次收获时就能轻松拿到2饭。,"At the start of the breeding phase of each harvest, if you have at least 1 unfenced stable without an animal, you get 1 sheep.",,,
E084,多莉的母亲,Dolly's Mother,,,,ドリーの母,和炉灶料理场配套可形成稳定的食物基础，因为繁殖不怎么占用空间，所以在拉起围栏后也更容易进行两种繁殖。,You only require 1 sheep to breed sheep during the breeding phase of a harvest. This card can hold 1 sheep.,,,
E085,制革大师,Master Tanner,,,,皮なめし職人,从序盘开始先占到调理场并进入家畜市场的话，就能做到增员。用这张卡增员后再增筑的话，增员的家人就会住进家里，但只要再吃1只家畜，就又能再次增员。和制盐不契合。,"For each wild boar or cattle that you turn into food, you can place 1 of that food on this card. While its food equals your number of rooms, this card provides room for 1 person.",,,
E086,栅栏制造商,Pen Builder,,,,檻作り,支付4木后可以进行3种繁殖。在木比较容易拿到的场面里效果还算可以。话虽如此，如果都要打出这张卡并支付木材，那也可以干脆老老实实攒木，早点拉起栅栏。,"At any time, you can place wood from your supply on this card, irretrievably. You can keep twice as many animals of any type on this card as there is wood on it.",,,
E087,翻修大师,Master Renovator,,,,改築名人,用在石家连招里吧。能降低资材消耗的效果也很令人开心。即便不靠石家连招也能起到压手牌的作用，但拿不到大进步这一点，以及为了收集资材而导致行动受限，这些算是小缺点。,"At the end of the work phases of rounds 7 and 9, you can take a ""Renovation"" action without placing a person and pay 1 building resource of your choice less.",,,
E088,栅栏大师,Master Fencer,,,,柵作りの達人,与各种石家连招卡片套装一起使用吧。,"Once you live in a stone house, at the start of each round, you can pay 2 or 3 wood to build up to 3 or 4 fences, respectively.",,,
E089,马厩工人,Stallwright,,,,厩大工,和职业系连招配套。第5张打出，就算只有2厩也还算不错。,"After you play your 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th occupation (including this one), you can build 1 stable at no cost.",,,
E090,收粪人,Dung Collector,,,,肥料収集家,如果能从3房开始进行2种繁殖，就能用4饭耕4块田。即使从5房开始发动，也能用2饭耕2块田，已经是绰绰有余的工作量。有像宠物仲买人那样的繁殖用卡就好好活用吧。,"Each time you get 2 or more newborn animals, you can pay 1 food to plow 1 field.",,,
E091,造犁师,Plow Builder,,,,畑作り,在木头较轻的场上，如果自己从序盘就拿家具制造的话，就是很优秀的效果。,"You can build the Joinery when taking a ""Minor Improvement"" action. If you use the Joinery (or an upgrade thereof) during the harvest, you can pay 1 food to plow 1 field.",,,
E092,田间医生,Field Doctor,,,,村医者,作为两户推进的搭档。想和耕作者或犁手助手套装一起用。,"Once this game, if you live in a house with exactly 2 rooms surrounded by 4 field tiles, you can use any ""Family Growth"" action space even without room.",,,
E093,榜样,Motivator,,,,牽引役,用于新土地或地主的随从。注意：如果把库存里的第5个人物也放置了，那么该回合就无法进行无家可归者增员了。,"On your first turn each round, if you have no unused farmyard spaces, you can place a person from your supply.",,,
E094,先知,Prophet,,,,預言者,可以随时进行强行动的改建栅栏。无论是为了防止终盘事故，还是为了在中盘压缩手牌都很强。不过要注意，无法在不能进行改建时为了建栅栏而打出。,"When you play this card, immediately take a ""Renovation"" action. Afterward, you can take a ""Build Fences"" action. (Both actions require their usual cost.)",,,
E095,磨坊主人,Miller,,,,製粉業者,小麦的补助偏多，没有小麦连锁的话不太容易被踩，作为烤面包补助不太稳定。主要效果感觉是即使大进已满也能打出进步。也能拿到灶台/烹饪场。还能打出小进的东方灶台或铁窑。反过来说如果没有能打出的进步这张卡也打不出来的样子，但恐怕是Bug，估计近期会修正。,"You can immediately build a baking improvement by paying its cost. Each time another player uses the ""Grain Seeds"" action space, you can take a “Bake Bread” action.",,,
E096,长者,Elder,,,,長老,为了尽快推进职业条件而使用的连招用卡。尤其是和受注生产职人组合的话，从第1手开始就能打出醸造所の池，或者在第2R目打出木材荷車也完全有机会。需要注意的是，打出第2张及以后职业时所需的食料有可能会增加。,You can play this card at the start of the work phase of round 1 without placing a person. (This card has no effect other than counting as a played occupation.),,,
E097,继承人,Beneficiary,,,,受益者,单体的话，是支付1饭来打出职业+进步的效果。注意，第4张以后再打出也不会发动。单体也不差，但和职业combo或与需要职业条件的进步成套时会更出彩。,"If this is your 3rd occupation, you can immediately play another occupation for an occupation cost of 1 food and/or play 1 minor improvement by paying its cost.",,,
E098,神童,Prodigy,,,,神童,如果从序盘开始就能打出、且有很多强力的进步的话，就更容易发挥作用。,"If this is your 1st occupation, you immediately get 1 bonus point for each improvement you have. (This will not apply to improvements played after this card.)",,,
E099,冷漠的父母,Uncaring Parents,,,,無関心な親,3阶石屋房子得4分。即使在13R把它变成石屋也只有2分，所以还算不错。如果能和其他石屋卡成套运用就很强力。,"At the end of each harvest, if you live in a stone house, you get 1 bonus point.",,,
E100,博物馆看守,Museum Caretaker,,,,博物館の館長,虽然行动会受限，但作为盘外得分卡还算不错。有收藏家的话，从第2R结束开始就能瞄准效果发动，相性很好。最高13点。,"At the start of each work phase, if you have at least 1 wood, 1 clay, 1 reed, 1 stone, 1 grain, and 1 vegetable in your supply, you get 1 bonus point.",,,
E101,讨厌鬼,Blighter,,,,はみだし者,放到第3ステ的话就是4点。如果没有其他强力的终盘用卡或盘外点卡的话，这效果还不算差。,"When you play this card, you get 1 bonus point for each complete stage left to play. You may not play any more occupations.",,,
E102,收购商,Acquirer,,,,獲得者,因为是物品，所以也能买家畜和种子。虽然是张想从序盘就发动的卡，但往往需要调理场，而且会受大进出现时机左右，这是缺点。和搾乳台等牛系卡或蔬菜的利用手段一起配套使用吧。也可以用手押し台车等端出离谱数量的饭，从中盘开始用的手法也有。,"At the start of each round, you may pay food equal to the number of people you have to buy 1 good of your choice from the general supply.",,,
E103,狼,Wolf,,,,狼,容易发动且效果强力。尤其是不仅能拿到野猪，还能获得小麦，这一点特别强。可以利用拿到的小麦一边烤面包一边繁殖野猪，也可以在料理场吃掉野猪。以童话「三只小猪」为主题,"Pile (from bottom to top) 1 clay, 1 wood, and 1 grain on this card. Each time you get a good matching the top item, you can move that item to your supply and get 1 wild boar.",,,
E104,香料商,Spice Trader,,,,香辛料商人,与其用掉第1阶段的1手1饭，不如用1手踩终盘的蔬菜+相当于2～3分的作用。序盘如果没事可做的话，踩踩田地感觉也行……,"If you play this card in round 4 or before, place 3 vegetables on the space for round 11. At the start of that round, you get the vegetables.",,,
E105,拓荒者,Pioneer,,,,開拓者,想和能强化猪1或牛1的动物爱好者、批发商之类的搭配成套使用。若是“1ステ大進めくれ”的情况，从首手起就能做到“开拓者→大进炉灶”的行动路线。即使改筑材少1也能放进动作里，因此实际上等于改筑+栅栏的资材减免1。,"When you play this card and each time before you use the most recent action space card, you get 1 building resource of your choice and 1 food.",,,
E106,砸锅卖铁者,Emergency Seller,,,,急ぎの売り手,想在芦苇和石头都比较轻的局里运用。先拿4芦苇再出手转换的话，两手能换出相当于11饭。要是没有别的饭基盘，这个饭效率还算可以。,"When you play this card, you can immediately turn as many building resources into food as you have people: 1 Wood / 1 Clay → 2 Food 1 Reed / 1 Stone → 3 Food",,,
E107,土地测量员,Land Surveyor,,,,測量技師,相对于条件能获得的饭偏少。用从序盘起就能发挥畑作用的手牌，或与耕运锄成套使用吧。作为畑扱い的卡也要计入。,"In the field phase of each harvest, if you have at least 2/4/6/7 fields, you get 1/2/3/4 food.",,,
E108,黑莓农夫,Blackberry Farmer,,,,ブラックベリー農家,注意这不是按正在建的栅栏数量算饭，而是按已建成的数量算饭。即使把栅栏分到7R和13R，也只有8饭左右，发挥作用的机会很少。,"Each time you build fences, place 1 food on each remaining round space, up to the number of fences just built. At the start of these rounds, you get the food.",,,
E109,发辫编织者,Braid Maker,,,,編みひも作り,即使有多个芦苇也只能转换一个。要注意这不是“打出进步”的效果，而是因为不是进步行动所以不能拿篮子制。,"Each harvest, you can use this card to exchange 1 reed for 2 food. You can build the Basketmaker's Workshop for 1 reed and 1 stone even when taking a ""Minor Impr."" action.",,,
E110,牙医,Dentist,,,,歯医者,在1阶段出，1～4阶段都放木的话，1步+4木能出18饭。木成本偏轻又没有饭基盘的话，这个饭效率不差。,"At the start of each harvest, you can place 1 wood from your supply on this card, irretrievably. In each feeding phase, you get 1 food for each wood on this card.",,,
E111,隐居者,Recluse,,,,世捨て人,如果是传给邻座的进步或大进步，拿出来也没问题。首手打出并启动到第2阶段也只是5饭2木的量，行动被限制的割に感觉有点不够。,"As long as you have no minor improvements in front of you, you get 1 food at the start of each round and 1 wood at the start of each harvest.",,,
E112,谷物小偷,Grain Thief,,,,穀物泥棒,如果能活用小麦的话，将是非常强力的效果。,"Each time you would harvest a grain field, you can leave the grain on the field and take 1 grain from the general supply instead.",,,
E113,教母,Godmother,,,,代母,想要活用蔬菜的手牌，或是从中盘开始撒蔬菜并在料理场吃掉的行动中使用吧。,"Each time you take a ""Family Growth"" action, you also get 1 vegetable.",,,
E114,棚舍建造师,Shed Builder,,,,物置小屋作り,和厩系连招一起成套。,"When you build your 1st and 2nd stable, you get 1 grain. When you build your 3rd and 4th stable, you get 1 vegetable. (This does not apply to stables you have already built.)",,,
E115,种子仆人,Seed Servant,,,,種の下僕,和畑番搭配时，一边获得小麦一边烤面包，或者一边获得蔬菜一边播种，是非常强力的卡。除此之外，基本上容易缺地，运用起来很难。,"Each time after you use the ""Grain Seeds"" or ""Vegetable Seeds"" action space, you can take a ""Bake bread"" or ""Sow"" action, respectively.",,,
E116,杉树砍伐者,Fir Cutter,,,,もみの木切り,序中盘的小行动中，羊1、猪1会开始附带2〜3木。单体也还不错，但和“动物爱好者”“家畜追赶者”搭配会更加出彩。,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 food. Each time after you use an animal accumulation space with your 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th person, you get 1/1/2/2/3 wood.",,,
E117,烟斗客,Pipe Smoker,,,,パイプ喫煙家,走1阶段小麦田路线的话是12木，就算从2阶段开始启动也有10木。最后收获的木用途有限，但即便扣掉这一点也很优秀,"At the start of each harvest, if you have at least 1 grain field, you get 2 wood.",,,
E118,燃料收集者,Kindling Gatherer,,,,薪切り,在资材市场、渔小剧日雇、家畜市场中发动。输出偏低，但能配合的连携对象相当多。注意：像铲子搬运工之类，即使通过卡牌效果获得食料也不会发动。,"Each time you get food from an action space, you get 1 additional wood.",,,
E119,土地继承人,Land Heir,,,,土地相続人,虽然是序盘的一手，但8资材很优秀。如果有木的家增筑士之类会成为延缓增筑理由的卡牌的话，无论如何都想打出来。,"If you play this card in round 4 or before, place 4 wood and 4 clay on the space for round 9. At the start of this round, you get the resources.",,,
E120,废料收集者,Scrap Collector,,,,くず回収者,无论是首回合打出还是在中盘打出，都是很优秀的效果。,"Alternate placing 1 wood and 1 clay on each of the next 6 round spaces, starting with wood. At the start of these rounds, you get the respective resource.",,,
E121,山地栽培师,Hill Cultivator,,,,丘の耕作者,与畑番或私人教师成套运用，前期多次进小麦，如果能高效确保用于改建或增建的砖块就很强力。在没有小麦补助或蔬菜补助的情况下打出，即便各进去1次也有5砖块，还算不错。,"Each time you use the ""Grain Seeds"" or ""Vegetable Seeds"" action space, you also get 2 or 3 clay, respectively.",,,
E122,苏格兰农民,Cottar,,,,小作農,如果手牌里有很多强力的进步，或者能收集到很多建筑设计图等进步的话就很优秀。能根据情况选择木材和砖块，灵活性很高。,"Each time you play or build an improvement, you get your choice of 1 wood or 1 clay immediately after paying its cost.",,,
E123,资源囤积者,Resource Hoarder,,,,資材ためこみ屋,如果能巧妙利用的话，一手就能有相当高的资源效率。要在序盘打出的话，稳妥的做法是先把砖用在什么地方，然后再通过增筑使用木葦。,"Pile resources as depicted on this card. (stone, clay, stone, reed, wood, clay) You can use the top item(s) when building a room, playing/building an improvement, or renovating.",,,
E124,市长候选人,Mayor Candidate,,,,市長候補者,可获得的资材不算差，但缺点也令人担心。有了家具制作所就不用担心木头会剩下，但石头的用途往往比较有限，所以要注意。,"You immediately get 2 wood and 2 stone. During scoring, you get 1 negative point for each wood and each stone in your supply. You can no longer discard wood or stone.",,,
E125,延误的旅人,Delayed Wayfarer,,,,遅れてきた旅人,,"When you play this card, you immediately get 1 building resource of your choice and, once all people have been placed this round, you can place a person from your supply.",,,
E126,收税人,Tax Collector,,B,,収税官,拿到木头并用来做栅栏材料的场景似乎很多。即使早点把栅栏拉完，也能用于厩舍，所以很容易一直发挥到终盘。,"Once you live in a stone house, at the start of each round, you get your choice of 2 wood, 2 clay, 1 reed, or 1 stone.",," In a big game, Tax collector might bring in 5 or 6 free resources, plus whatever you buy. Slightly awkward in that it gives you resources when others build improvements, but those resources are often most useful for buying the Majors yourself. Still, very high upside. Should be banned in FotM. ",
E127,,Diligent Farmer,,,,勤勉な農夫,要在中盘发动的话有点难的效果。可以在14R打出并进行石家增筑，最多也能做到3分，但由于效果的关系，田地和栅栏很容易把版面占满，不提前准备好增筑空间也是不容易运用的点之一。,"When you play this card, if you would score the maximum 4 points in 3 scoring categories (including fenced stables), you can extend your house by 1 room at no cost.",,,
E128,马具工匠,Saddler,,,,馬具屋,能耕2块田的话效果还不错。年轻农夫是最佳搭档。用灶台/料理场转换时也会触发。,"Each time after you build a major improvement, you can pay 1 food to plow 1 field.",,,
E129,,Imitator,,,,模倣者,增员进步、大进、改建大进、栅栏、种面包、蔬菜为对象。和万事屋发掘者组合，在大进步里进好几次的情况似乎最能发挥作用。自己在里面也能进去。,"If you have a person on the ""Day Laborer"" action space, you can use non-accumulating round 1-9 action spaces even if they are occupied.",,,
E130,,Overachiever,,,,やり手,家具筹措人的亲戚。虽然没有爆发力，但能稳定地瞄准3次起动。还能减轻かま調和窯的成本，这点很让人高兴。,"Each time you use a ""Wish for Children"" action space, you can play 1 additional improvement by paying its cost less 1 resource of your choice.",,,
E131,,Market Master,,,,市場長,从开局起就能在不消耗饭的情况下把职业摆出来很强力。有小剧场combo的话更不用说。因为是先获得食料再出职业，所以即使出了涂装艺术家或魔术师，出的那回合效果也不会启动。,"Immediately after each time you place your last person in a round on the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space, you can play 1 occupation for an occupation cost of 1 food.",,,
E132,,Veggie Lover,,,,野菜愛好家,粮食和分数的转换效率都还不错。和优秀的田地辅助或播种辅助搭配使用吧。,Harvest: At most 1 time 1 Grain+1 Vegetable → 6 Food Scoring: 1 Grain+1 Vegetable/2 Grain+2 Vegetable/3 Grain+3 Vegetable → 2/4/6 bonus points,,,
E133,冠军饲养员,Champion Breeder,,,,チャンピオンブリーダー,在5格、6格只要繁殖3种就能拿4分。从中盘开始拉栅栏繁殖2种的话，大概能拿到6分。有像宠物中间人那样的繁殖用卡的话就活用吧。,"Each time you place 2 or 3+ newborn animals on your farm during the breeding phase of the harvest, you get 1 or 2 bonus points, respectively.",,,
E134,全能农夫,Omnifarmer,,,,総合農家,面向高级玩家的卡。把每件物品按1个0.5分来换算的话，放置4种时相当于1行动+2分变成7分，放置5种时相当于1行动+2.5分变成9分，放得越多得分效率越好。从阶段2开始每回合都触发似乎很难，但从阶段3开始启动4次的话，看起来不算太勉强就能瞄准。建议和能大量产出种子或家畜的卡配套使用，比如小贩、动物爱好者、收藏家、贸易教师等。,"Each harvest, you can place 1 harvested crop or 1 newborn animal on this card, irretrievably. Once this game, exchange 2/3/4/5 different goods on this for 3/5/7/9 bonus points.",,,
E135,,Pickler,,,,ピクルス作り,如果要活用田地和蔬菜的话，是很优秀的4木职业。,"If there are still 1/3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 1/2/3/4 wood. During scoring, each player with the most total vegetables gets 3 bonus points.",,,
E136,畜牧工人,Animal Husbandry Worker,,,,畜産労働者,在11R之前打出的话，可以一边获得木材一边建造栅栏。只要在第1阶段打出就能建立牧场，因此即便是从前期开始进行家畜繁殖的情况下也可以活用。12R以后打出的话，建造栅栏的效果也不会发动，注意。想要稳拿奖励需要15根栅栏的5格牧场。,"If there are still 3/6/9 complete rounds left to play, you immediately get 2/3/4 wood and a ""Build Fences"" action. During scoring, each player with the most pastures gets 2 bonus points.",,,
E137,,Flax Farmer,,,,亜麻農家,如果能稳定进2芦苇的话，就是还不错的小麦辅助。用小麦格连招打出来的话，想确保芦苇的用法。,"Each time you use the ""Reed Bank"" accumulation space, you also get 1 grain. Each time you use the ""Grain Seeds"" action space, you also get 1 reed.",,,
E138,,Livestock Expert,,,,家畜の専門家,由于要在11R以前出，所以如果大量增加的话，确保存放饲养空间似乎会很困难。把家畜翻倍后立刻烤掉的场景看起来会很多。,"If you play this card in round 11 or before, choose an animal type: you immediately get a number of animals of that type equal to the number you already have on your farm.",,,
E139,,Bunny Breeder,,,,ウサギ飼い,经常是在中盘打出，然后在14R放饭的用法似乎会很多。,"Select a future round space, subtract the number of the current round from it, and place this many food on that space. At the start of that round, you get the food.",,,
E140,,Carter,,,,荷馬車の運転手,在下回合有机会拿到6木或6砖的时机打出吧。因为不是累积格就无法发挥效果，所以要注意。由于强化小行动的效果很多，场上的资源越是饱和就越强力。有森林保护者在场时也更容易发挥作用。,"Next round, each time you use a building resource accumulation space, you also get 1 food for each building resource that you take from the space.",,,
E141,蔬菜推销员,Vegetable Vendor,,,,野菜販売人,即使是经常会拥挤的大进步行动也能用蔬菜来支付。序盘拿取厨房时也顺便把蔬菜一起拿上，拿去播种或烤来用也很优秀。,"Each time you use the ""Major Improvement"" or ""Vegetable Seeds"" action space, you also get 1 vegetable or a ""Major or Minor Improvement"" action, respectively.",,,
E142,,Smuggler,,,,密輸業者,由于也会出现小麦和石头都稍微不够的情况，所以用这种灵活好用的效果算是还不错。在木头占比重的局面下，果然就很难发挥其效果。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, you can exchange up to 2 goods as follows: 1 Wood → 1 Grain or 1 Grain → 1 Stone",,,
E143,采煤工,Hewer,,,,炭鉱夫,对他人的依赖很大，难以稳定触发。只要有人进了砖，另一方就自己进去，这样下个回合就更容易触发。,"From round 3 on, at the end of each work phase in which all clay accumulation spaces are unoccupied, you get 1 stone and 1 food.",,,
E144,仓库推销员,Wares Salesman,,,,セールスマン,虽说要到中盘以后，但能大量产出芦苇。能打出联动的卡意外地多。,"Each time any player (including you) plays or builds a card that lets them turn building resources into food, you get exactly 1 corresponding building resource and 1 reed.",,,
E145,偷懒的人,Parvenu,,,,成金,大量收集砖块，想把它衔接到砖房增筑上。如果场上芦苇很重的话，也可以多拿2芦苇，然后在下一回合进行2间增筑。,"If you play this card in round 7 or before, choose clay or reed: you immediately get a number of that building resource equal to the number you already have in your supply.",,,
E146,,Reseller,,,,転売人,在拿取水井、石窑等时先放出来比较稳妥。拿取篮子制品等时也一样，因为可以有效利用回收回来的芦苇，所以更容易运用。,"Once this game, immediately after playing or building an improvement, you can choose to get its printed cost from the general supply.",,,
E147,,Animal Driver,,,,家畜乗り,效果不坏，但条件有点偏苛刻。,"At the start of each harvest, if you have 1/2/3+ fenced stables, you get 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle.",,,
E148,,Lazybones,,,,怠け者,如果有日雇组合的话就是4厩。光是3厩也已经是相当不错的效果。,"Place (up to) 1 stable each on ""Grain Seeds"", ""Farmland"", ""Day Laborer"", and ""Farm Expansion"". Build the stable at no cost when another player uses that action space.",,,
E149,,Midnight Fencer,,,,真夜中の柵作り,,"At the start of the last harvest, you can take up to 2 of each other player's unbuilt fences and build them on your farm at no cost. (Your farm can then have over 15 fences.)",,,
E150,,Rock Beater,,,,石打ち,和“资材市场系”的连锁卡组合一起出会比较稳妥。如果有木匠或木匠的铁锤，也可以瞄准石制多户增筑。再加上捆柴或采石的话，就是次世代型公寓。,You can use an action space providing both stone and a different building resource even if it is occupied by another player. Stone rooms cost you 2 stone less each.,,,
E151,护士,Delivery Nurse,,,,分娩看護師,如果能尽早拉上篱笆的话，就是非常优秀的效果。只要能在中盘之前确保到牛，就能发挥相当大的威力。,"Once this game, if you have all types of animals, use any ""Family Growth"" action space even without room.",,,
E152,,Bargain Hunter,,,,バーゲンハンター,如果可以的话，想和小剧场相关的Combo和套装一起运用。,"At the start of each round, you can place 1 food from your supply on the ""Traveling Players"" accumulation space to play a minor improvement by paying its cost.",,,
E153,,Stone Sculptor,,,,石の彫刻家,森林保护者、发掘者、万事屋等，只要能大量出石，就能不费力地拿到6分6饭。如果没法轻松供应石头，那就别出这个，去瞄准井户似乎更强。,"Each harvest, you can use this card to exchange exactly 1 stone for 1 bonus point and 1 food.",,,
E154,,Margrave,,,,辺境伯,自身改建成石屋时也能拿到2饭。若以饭为目的，大多数情况下用仆人会更好操作吧。终盘多半会为了得分目的而打出。,"Once you live in a stone house, you get 2 food each time any player renovates and, during scoring, 1 bonus point for each wood house and clay house.",,,
E155,,Visionary,,,,空想家,只要先拉出4根栅栏，就能从第1ステ开始进行野猪繁殖，连蔬菜和石头也能拿到。只要除自己以外的3个人都按部就班地扩建增员，这效果就相当优秀。自己走2軒进行的情况下当然也很强。在竞技场规则里感觉会被禁用。,"If you play this card in round 4 or before, you get 1 stone, 1 vegetable, and 2 wild boar. You cannot grow your family until round 11, unless all other players already have.",,,
E156,土矿主人,Claypit Owner,,,,粘土坑所有者,虽然比“炭烧”的发动对象更广，但即使由自己打出也不会发动。草拟时要读懂其他玩家的动向，再考虑要不要打出。,"Each time another player plays or builds an improvement with a printed clay cost, you get 1 food and 1 clay.",,,
E157,,Usufructuary,,,,使用権利人,在1ステ结束时打出来的话，感觉能到5饭左右。,"When you play this card as your first occupation, you immediately get 1 food for every other occupation in play (by any player), up to a maximum of 7 food.",,,
E158,,Stone Custodian,,,,,,"At the end of each work phase, you get 1 food for each stone accumulation space with stone on it.",,,
E159,,Old Miser,,,,老いた守銭奴,人类大猩猩化计划。如果在第1ステ放出，若是以最快冲到5人为目标的玩法风格，就会以失去5分为代价，换来大约20〜25饭左右的产出。没有井户或比较强的盘外点卡的话，果然还是赢不到最后。,"In the feeding phase of each harvest, each of your people requires 1 less food. During scoring, your people are worth 2 points each instead of 3.",,,
E160,,Kelp Gatherer,,,,海藻集め,虽然依赖他人，但似乎能产出约3个蔬菜左右。种植蔬菜并在厨房烤制等加以利用吧。如果有渔业Combo就能大量入手，但相应地渔业Combo的玩家也会受益，因此需要格外警惕。,"Each time another player uses the ""Fishing"" accumulation space, they get 1 additional food and you get 1 vegetable.",,,
E161,,Elder Baker,,,,パン職人の長老,第1次踩3小麦做石窑，再踩一次3小麦后用“谷物活用”进行2播2烤，应该会成为基本打法。死守石窑，只要“谷物活用”不出事故，光靠这一张就足够成为稳定的吃饭基盘。,"This card is an action space for you only. When you use it, you get 3 grain. You can build the ""Stone Oven"" major improvement even when taking a ""Minor Improvement"" action.",,,
E162,,Entrepreneur,,,,起業家,1饭换2资材，换算效率相当优秀，但限定为自己没有的资材，稍微有点不好用。像雕刻学科或钟铸造师那样，如果能频繁把资材用完，就更容易发挥作用。,"At the start of each round, you can move 1 food to this card or discard 1 food from it. If you do either, you get 1 building resource of a type you currently do not have.",,,
E163,,Patroness,,,,女パトロン,虽然是用于职业套牌，但和赞助人相比，缺点是它本身并不能对排列职业作出贡献。准备另外的食物基础吧。,"Each time after you play an occupation after this one, you get 1 building resource of your choice.",,,
E164,,Mountain Plowman,,,,山の耕作者,与锄系搭配即可获得羊繁殖套装。,"Each time you plow at least 1 field tile, you get 1 sheep for each field tile that you just plowed.",,,
E165,狩猎大师,Master Huntsman,,,,熟練猟師,只要在14R出1只野猪也能起到最低限的作用。如果有繁殖空间的话，还可以在第1ステ一边拿烹饪场一边瞄准野猪繁殖。,"When you play this card and each time you build a major improvement, you get 1 wild boar.",,,
E166,,Roastmaster,,,,肉焼き名人,如果有調理場就是能做出+2飯的工作量，但若是拿了調理場後又反覆去漁小劇，手效率就會稍微變差。請和能發揮牛作用的卡搭配使用，盡早讓牛繁殖。,"Each time you use the ""Traveling Players"" or ""Fishing"" accumulation spaces, you can move exactly 1 food from that space to the other to get 1 cattle.",,,
E167,,Dairy Crier,,,,酪農家,把获得的羊或牛用于繁殖吧。想在别人准备好灶台/烹饪场或家畜栏位之前先打出来。就算在家畜为0的状态下打到5ステ，最终也会变成羊4牛1，所以效果也还算不错。,"When you play this card, each player (including you) can choose to get 2 sheep or 2 food; you also get 1 cattle.",,,
E168,,Animal Tamer's Apprentice,,,,見習い調教師,即使进行多次扩建，也能获得大量的家畜。与在回合结束时扩建的周日木工非常契合。,"At the start of each round, you get 1 sheep/wild boar/cattle for each unoccupied wood/clay/stone room in your house.",,,
